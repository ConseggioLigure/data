%             
%             Statement of Purpose
%             
%             The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
%             exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
%             and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
%             authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
%             
%             Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
%             the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
%             scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
%             of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
%             works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
%             and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
%             These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
%             culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
%             works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
%             part through the use and efforts of others.
%             
%             For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
%             expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
%             associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
%             is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
%             elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
%             terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
%             Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
%             
%             1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
%             protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
%             Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
%             limited to, the following:
%             
%               i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
%                  communicate, and translate a Work;
%              ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
%             iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
%                  likeness depicted in a Work;
%              iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
%                  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
%               v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
%                  in a Work;
%              vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
%                  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
%                  protection of databases, and under any national implementation
%                  thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
%                  directive); and
%             vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
%                  world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
%                  implementations thereof.
%             
%             2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
%             of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
%             irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
%             Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
%             of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
%             future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
%             worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
%             treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
%             medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
%             including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
%             purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
%             member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
%             successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
%             revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
%             equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
%             as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
%             
%             3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
%             be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
%             Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
%             account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
%             extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
%             person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
%             irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
%             Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
%             maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
%             time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
%             of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
%             limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
%             "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
%             applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
%             reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
%             partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
%             of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
%             will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
%             Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
%             action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
%             express Statement of Purpose.
%             
%             4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
%             
%              a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
%                 surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
%              b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
%                 warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
%                 statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
%                 title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
%                 infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
%                 the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
%                 the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
%              c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
%                 that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
%                 limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
%                 Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
%                 consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
%                 Work.
%              d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
%                 party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
%                 this CC0 or use of the Work.
