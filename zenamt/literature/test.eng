The Genoese Anonym (13th cent.)
The one we call the “Dante” of the Genoese and who, as far as we know, is the founder of our literature, comes to us without a name and we call him “the Genoese Anonym”.
There were those who, searching through his texts, thought he was called Luchetto, and those who thought he was Simone, but there is no definite proof.
Perhaps it is better that way; the Anonym is not the voice of an individual, but of an entire city and an era, when civic virtues counted more than the initiative of a single person.
With him, we are still in the days when a poet could embody an entire nation, without too much effort; later on will come those who regret “the olden days”.
Later on still, those who indulge in navel-gazing and think that everyone else ought to care.
And finally, rebellion and blasphemy, the maddening love and the lack of meaning in life.
But with the Anonym we are still in the early days, with a father who tells us: “You, man who goes his own way / healthy and young, fresh and strong / don’t go astray / like a ship without a helmsman”, to a man who is thrilled by his people’s victories in war, united in his feelings, in his passions, in his world view.
And he feels that God is on his side because he is on the side of the righteous; before the battle of Korčula, the Venetians rejected all proposals for peace, but “where there is no place for reason, / as the doctors of the church have written / man can, to defend his right, / put up arms”.
But when the enemies are beaten, “the noble heart of the Genoese” will take pity on them and release more than four hundred.
“For God foresaw / that their hearts were poisoned / and those of the humble Genoese / gave us victory.”
The Anonym was a deeply religious poet, with a moderately moralistic worldview inspired by an absolute faith in divine justice.
Lucheto’s profound religious inspiration lends certain of his verses a great dramatic intensity.
Here, the Madonna narrates the different stages of the Passion of Jesus to an interlocutor.
The Genoese Anonym is also, and above all, a civil poet, who from the pride of being Genoese manages to create a true epic, resounding and powerful, as can be seen in his historical poems: all a hymn to the courage of the Ligurians and their pietas, thanks to which they will prevail over their enemies.
In the victories of Laiazzo (1294) and Korčula (1298) achieved against the Venetians, the poet sees the hand of God, supporting the Genoese army, because it was formed by virtuous men and led by wise and pious admirals against an enemy guilty of countless iniquities.
The archaic vigour of the language lends an indefinable suggestiveness to these verses, but also makes them a difficult read for contemporary Genoese speakers.
Even the “Dante of the Genoese”, while being an observant Guelph, writes, like the Italian Dante, a poem in favor of the coming of Henry VII of Luxembourg to Italy, and he too hopes that the Emperor will be able to make the enemy factions, who were fighting each other, righteous, so that he can restore peace, serenity and the fear of God to a desolate and ravaged territory, such as what had become “lo giardin de lo Imperio” in those days.
The Anonym uses a long seafaring metaphor to sketch the desperate situation of Italy at that time and compares it to the dangers and hardships, which Genoese sailors have to face continuously for their survival. He thus achieves a remarkable poetic effect.
We quote here the first part of this important text, which also served as the basis for a beautiful song by Roberta Alloisio, in her album Janua.
Official uses of the Genoese language in the 14th and 15th centuries
In the 14th and 15th centuries, the use of Genoese also spread in official documents: the Commune gave political instructions in Genoese to its appointees and diplomats abroad and sent letters to monarchs and other personalities outside the state, as in the case of the letter of instructions to Sicurano on a mission to the king of Cyprus, or like the proposals to the king of Hungary for an alliance against the Venetians.
This is also the case with the Treaty with the Khan of the Tartars, where it is laid down how relations between the “Franks” (the Westerners) and the Tartars themselves are to be regulated.
Genoese was, in those days, a lingua franca, useful for relations between East and West, and Genoa exercised a sort of protectorate and patronage over the Westerners in their dealings with the Easterners.
A very famous historical and linguistic document is the letter report by Biagio Assereto, commander of the Genoese fleet, written after the “bloody battle” of Ponza and addressed, among others (translated into Italian), to Filippo Maria Visconti, then lord of Liguria.
That the author of the extraordinary victory against two kings, a viceroy, a prince and “an infinity of other barons, knights and gentlemen” was a notary and politician who lent himself to war, and not an admiral or a soldier, is a fact that struck the imagination of many, literary men, historians, and politicians alike: from Foglietta and Cigala, to Spotorno, to the Ligurian regionalists of the late 19th century, to D’Annunzio, for whom the battle won by Assereto represented the rebirth and revenge of the Genoese – or Italian, depending on the political nuance – people and the bourgeoisie against the nobles and the powerful, and moreover foreign ones.
The writing is polluted with various Italianisms, and not too significant in terms of language, but has more of a documentary value.
Early writers of the Riviera: Religious Lauds of Savona, Pietra Ligure, Albenga (14th–15th cent.)
The religious poetry of the end of the 14th century, designed to be learnt by heart by the orators, the memmbers of the companies of the oratories, later called “Casacce”, is always the same, repeating formulas and themes, since the poetry of a civilisation at its dawn does not demand originality from its authors. On the contrary, it keeps away from it as much as possible, and instead demands absolute fidelity to unchanging archetypes, so that its poets remain nameless, but are the voice of a people, just as in a Byzantine icon one does not look for the originality and individualistic eagerness of modern painters, who sign their works because they wants to “make a name for themselves”, but for their adherence to the sacred tradition that has come down to our times and respect for symbols that are always the same.
The first poets of the Riviera are therefore anonymous and sacred. F. Toso rightly speaks of a “barbaric” evocation that these documents present to us.
What’s remarkable in these lauds is the purity of the language and the spelling style, which are essentially the same as those of the Genoese language of the time, albeit of clearly local expression.
The palatal ‹c› sound is rendered with ‹j› or ‹ih›: jama, ihamar for the modern ciamma e ciammâ.
The nexuses ‹pi› and ‹bi› are pronounced ‹ci› and ‹gi›: pim corresponds to cin; pianzando to cianzando; abi is read agi.
Historian Paolo Accame, who discovered these lauds in the parish of Pietra Ligure and published them in 1889, pointed out how, in this fragment of a laud for the feast of St. John, the anonymous author – who lived in a time of uprisings and civil wars – inserts his prayer for the Lord to send “peace and consolation” to his homeland and seems to feel almost envious of the “citae”, which preserves the relics of John the Baptist in its cathedral.
F. Toso notes, with regard to this prayer from 1461 (already in the midst of the decadence of 15th-century Ligurian clouded by Tuscan forms), a purer language, with genuine ingauni dialectal traits.
Francesco Maria Marini (17th cent.)
Francesco Maria Marini was the son of Doge Giovanni Agostino, and in 1642 he had Il Fazzoletto performed, a multilingual comedy where, along with the Genoese of the usual Caporale, the Bolognese of Dr. Graziano and the rather improbable Tuscan spoken by some Turkish nobles are also on stage.
This is a comedy of political intentions, in which the Doge is exhorted to good government, so that reason and concord triumph over tyranny and arbitrariness. It is difficult to read nowadays because of the complex language full of double entendres of its characters, especially those who speak Genoese, and explanatory notes would be needed at every line to understand it.
In the following scene, the Corporal and his mistress Bellora (Weasel), who seems to have found a richer lover, poke each other and she tries to leave him, accusing him of apostasy and of having syphilis.
Note that “diseases” and “seas”, are in Old Genoese homophones, so by speaking of “embarking for the seas of France” Bellora alludes to the possibility for Caporale to have infected himself with “French disease”.
Martino Piaggio (1774–1843)
Martino Piaggio (1774-1843) is one of the best known Genoese poets, even by those who know nothing about Genoese; the wide circulation in his time of the Lunario del Signor Regina has meant that everyone, more or less, has heard of it.
Piaggio, however, is more than a poet, he is a chronicler – often sympathetic and nonchalant – of the Genoese reality of his time; a witness to the Restoration years, which saw the end of the illusions brought about by the French Revolution throughout Europe, and in Liguria the end of independence and annexation to Piedmont, Piaggio draws from these events his resigned moral: “in political affairs don’t go meddling / he who is born to obey must not command”.
And then: “revolutions produce trouble / and he who obeys never fails”.
On the other hand, at that time there was nothing else to do, for those who did not wish to be bothered; at most one could make subtle and polite jibes, never mentioning the government, highlighting the city’s problems starting with the health problems, lashing out at usurers and exorbitant landlords; We remember towards the end of his life what we would now call a journalistic campaign in favour of the smallpox vaccine; a writer in many respects still from the 18th century, rationalist and reasoner, he gives his best in an almost mechanical comedy, from puppet theatre, expressed by a hammering, almost obsessive octonary verse.
One of the most famous fables of his Genovese Aesop, The Two Misers inspired the famous comedy by Govi Pignasecca and Pignaverde and is typical for its accumulation of situations that are anything but realistic, like a true popular poet; in comparison, we observe that Govi’s comedy loses itself in details of bourgeois theatre that detract from its satirical value and indulges in consolatory and familistic rhetoric, precisely where Piaggio tells us the end of the two moneylenders with words of cold and mocking condemnation: “they were found by one of his neighbours / both of them with a rat in their mouths / a worthy end for a miser”.
Piaggio is only on the surface a good-natured poet, throwing down verses as they come; in reality he is steeped in the culture of his time, as can be seen when he takes literary motifs from those years and adapts them to the conditions of Genoese society.
In one long poem, he describes some rather Goldonian “cravings for holidays”, while in the one we quote here, he makes a “young gentleman” speak that is almost Parini-like.
Genoese newspapers and journalists of the 19th century
In the second half of the 19th century, there were a number of prominent periodicals written entirely in Genoese, such as O Balilla, O Stafî, O Zeneize. They were targeted at the working classes, had markedly liberal and anti-monarchist tendencies and engaged in many civil battles, such as gender equality, government failures, construction scandals, mismanagement of hospitals, but they were also often prone to scandals and were implicated in rather dark matters of blackmail and defamation.
There are therefore few names of journalists of whom we have certain information. Amongst them are Giuseppe Poggi, the first editor of O Balilla – a biweekly newspaper that ran continuously between 1868 and 1904 – and Edoardo Michele Chiozza (1850-1908).
Both had problems with the law, following accusations of defamation. The former, in 1873; the latter – a particularly quarrelsome and slanderous character who even fought a duel – suffered a harsh sentence in 1883, in a trial that ended his career.
They authored serial novels, such as Ginn-a de Sampedænn-a (Poggi) and investigations such as I quartê pövei de Zena (Chiozza). It is quite difficult to establish how well-founded the accusations against them were or how much was due to the annoyance of the authorities of the time towards a press that, all things considered, guaranteed the continuity of a Genoese written expression that was not resigned to being a simple means of escapism.
The novels published in episodes in Genoese newspapers did not spare criticism of the social structure of the time, the Church, and the trade unions.
Here is an excerpt from Doe compagne de scheua.
Nicolò Bacigalupo (1837–1904)
Nicolò Bacigalupo was a highly educated individual, a connoisseur of classical and major modern languages. He was Treasurer of the Municipality of Genoa, an amateur of figurative arts and acting, and some of his plays, such as I manezzi pe maiâ ’na figgia, became workhorses of Gilberto Govi.
His work, mostly burlesque in character, had a great influence on a great many authors, who identified, and sometimes still identify, Genoese poetry with the cheap double entendre joke.
The great success of Bacigalupo’s work testifies to the moment when the Genoese language truly became a “dialect”, in the sense of a language subordinate to another of greater prestige, and now destined only for uses of little importance, with the approval of the audience of the time. The decline of Genoese is also evident from the lexical and syntactic point of view. While Italianisms appear more and more frequently, sentence construction is also often traced back to Italian.
However, Bacigalupo also sometimes manages to be a fairly convincing poet with a melancholic and pensive vein, as in the cycle of sonnets dedicated to the Ligurian Riviera.
Among his best-known texts, the parody version of the Eneid, O pappagallo de moneghe, Montecatini, Inni civili, O canto da rumenta.
In the poem Montecatini (1902), Bacigalupo describes the well-known spa resort, a favorite destination of the Genoese bourgeoisie, and takes the opportunity to portray stereotypical characters and caricatures, brilliantly aided by the mischievous stroke of cartoonist Giuseppe Garuti, also known as Pipein Gamba, also known as Pipinus da Modona, famous for his Belle Époque style sketches of damsels, which were considered provocative at the time.
The visitor begins to discern and even recognize famous people:
The review of stereotypical characters goes on, and with it the satirical jabs:
Apparently, however, o sciô Nicolin was not just going there to pass the waters:
In the second half of the nineteenth century, Nicolò Bacigalupo’s theatrical production is thoroughly disengaged, pure entertainment, seeking easy comic effects. His characters are nothing more than conventional stereotypes: the grumpy old man, the schemer, the miser, the mischievous servant girl, the young lovers. Some of these take up figures from the traditional Baroque theater of the seventeenth century, but in an entirely different context, in a theatrical game disengaged from all reality, a world apart, functioning on its own.
Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that these works are of some interest, if only in the construction of the perfectly paced plot and also in the language, usually more blunt and idiomatic than in the poems of this same author.
In the famous Piggiâse o mâ do Rosso o Cartâ (1870), the meddlesome Pippo Manezzi, although in good faith, causes great trouble for others, but especially for himself, because of his eagerness to want to “do good” at any cost.
It was one of Gilbero Govi’s most successful performances early in his career, but was later gradually abandoned. What may interest us moderns about this play is the theatrical mechanism, relentless as clockwork.
Also to be taken into account is the perfect Genoese, not at all watered down and highly expressive.
Federico Gazzo (1845–1926)
Federico Gazzo (1845-1926), in religion known as Father Angelico, a Capuchin who spent his childhood and youth in Argentina, was one of the few writers who lived between the 19th and 20th centuries, indeed the only one, who considered Genoese a language and not a dialect.
His complete translation of Dante’s Divine Comedy must be understood in this sense, according to what he himself says: to bring to light once again the riches of the Genoese language, without looking for other languages, and to this end to make use of all the possibilities of our ancient, modern, popular and literary language, of all its varieties, expedients, freedoms and rights, so as to show the vastness and power of the “Ligurian idiom”.
And, indeed, in his version of Dante’s poem, one can find rustic words, like those of the literary language, and courtly ones, like those of the hinterland, as needed.
In his time, Gazzo, as a solitary thinker, found hardly anyone to follow him, as the intellectuals and ruling class in Genoa at the time were rather absorbed by the idea of participating in building a common homeland, Italy, also from a literary and linguistic point of view.
But nowadays it might be time for those who write in Genoese to take up the work of the Capuchin and the criteria that guided him once again; we would then realise that, to a large extent, they can serve us even now, in the re/creation of a modern literary and journalistic language.
A gifted linguist, Gazzo had also compiled dictionaries of Amerindian languages and dialects, intended to serve him in his missions (which have been lost), a grammar of Genoese, and many translations from major European literatures, including the complete version of Orlando furioso, which took the work started by Vincenzo Dartona in the 16th century and completed it.
These are all works that have never been published and would deserve to be brought to the world’s attention, if possible.
Gazzo performed numerous translations from European languages; we present here his version of Quevedo’s famous sonnet on the death of the Duke of Osuna, considered one of the masterpieces of Spanish poetry, whose “sanguine moon” seemed so memorable to J. L. Borges.
Giuseppe Cava (1870–1940)
Giuseppe Cava was born in Savona. He was a anarchist factory worker, self-taught, who lost a leg in an accident at work and later became a printer and journalist.
Sentenced to six months in prison in 1894, after serving his sentence he went to France, Switzerland and Germany.
He returned to Savona in 1902, and began publishing the weekly magazine Il marciapiede.
In 1934, he was employed at the civic library A. G. Barrili, from which he was dismissed four years later for political reasons.
His poems from Savona are collected in the silloge Into remoin (1930). The author’s political passion does not shine through these poems at all – perhaps because they were published in times of dictatorship – but they are suffused with a moderate lyricism, a tenuous pastoral style and a vernacular attention to local color.
In his most successful verses, Cava (also known by the nickname “Beppin da Cà”) recalls the musicality of his illustrious countryman Gabriello Chiabrera, but the overall effect is somewhat reminiscent of a latecoming Arcadia.
In the cycle of poems dedicated to his dead daughter, the freethinker Cava instead finds poignant accents of spirituality.
This poem and the next, very suitable to be set to music, were sung by Roberta Alloisio and collected respectively in her albums Lengua Serpentina and Janua.
Sandro Patrone (1917–2004)
Patrone was a great admirer of Firpo and strove to emulate him. Unlike him, however, he sought more of a connection and communion with his fellow man, but he was very close to him in his feeling for nature, and in his great attention to the small things of life, which seemed to him to speak their own simple, eternal language.
A graduate in accountancy, he tried – as he himself recounts in the preface to his first volume of lyrics – to sweeten the arid life of a clerk with a pinch of humanism, which he found on his own by searching.
His debut in Genoese poetry came with a flat and discursive reduction of the subject matter of the Gospels into octaves – a work that does not present characters of particular originality, but which achieved considerable success in its time.
A free alternation of variously rhymed parisyllabic and imparisyllabic verses creates a cadenced musicality that is almost hypnotic, inducing in the reader a sense of fatality, of pensive enchantment on the shores of deep night, so that what might be the narrative of a trivial fact becomes charged with meaning and symbolic allusions. Needless to say, this complex interplay of rhymes, assonances and occult resonances is completely lost in the Italian version.
Patrone’s symbolic allusions, while closely resembling Firpo’s, are by comparison more elaborate, less straightforward.
As noted above, Patrone’s poetry is characterized by a careful play of rhymes and assonances, always carefully tuned to changing moods and designed to underscore the author’s ability to reveal his own free and creative world, often nocturnal in its setting, as opposed to the frequently disappointing and slovenly waking world.
Vito Elio Petrucci (1923–2002)
Petrucci – another great follower of Firpo and in some ways his imitator – composed, over the course of his long career, a large number of poems that testify to his love of Genoa and of nature, which sometimes descend into folklorism, but – in his finest moments – are enchanted in a dreamy atmosphere, in a time suspended outside of time, that is particularly evocative.
He was also an indefatigable promoter of a somewhat conventional idea of “Genoeseness”, and he produced countless collections of proverbs, memories, cooking recipes, old period photos and annotated postcards.
As a playwright and director of theater and radio, he was a proponent of Govi’s theater, as such repurposing old Govian texts, or writing new ones along the same lines, in a generic attempt to update and modernize them, but most of the time with rather wishful and dubious results.
The best part of Petrucci’s poetry is where the author, following in Firpo’s footsteps, describes the Ligurian landscape in inspired and dreamy terms, suspended in an aura of eternity and idealized perfection, broken only by sudden reminders of the concreteness of everyday life.
Porto Pidocchio is a small inlet of the Portofino headland, between Camogli and Punta Chiappa, whose name refers to the narrow space reserved for boats.
One of Petrucci’s favorite themes in his poetry is his dissatisfaction with the present world, in which the dreams and hopes of childhood and youth are irretrievably erased by modernity, new concepts, ideas and prejudices, hand in hand with the disappearance of “Genoeseness”.
A sense of lost fatalistic abandonment exhales from Petrucci’s verses, hopelessly tied to his land and its myths.
Compared to Firpo’s poetry, Petrucci’s verses are distinguished by a greater sensuality, a radical attachment to life and the earth.
In the poet’s perspective even death is not scary – it represents the end of all turmoil, all pain, as well as the end of the race of time and a total pantheistic immersion in nature, with which one identifies.
Foreshadowed in this dialogue with the stones is the poet’s complete fusion with his land and his city, which seem to incite him to take up all their concerns, their vicissitudes, and to become their spokesman.
For Petrucci, the end of Genoa coincides with the end of the world itself.
Here, as in the following poem, brief glimpses and lyrical illuminations, in full Firpian tradition.
In his last collection of poems, O monòlogo, included in the personal anthology Un vento doçe (1993), Petrucci manages to combine folkloric and traditional themes with his meditations on the end and the beyond of life, as in this Serenade, where the mystery of the afterlife is brought back to everyday reality, in which a husband returns home to his wife, an evening like any other.
Silvio Opisso (1884–1965)
He was director of Ansaldo Coke and in the 1920s contributed to the newspaper Il Lavoro.
Opisso was involved, just like other authors of the time such as Carbone, Firpo, Acquarone, in the Canson zeneise movement, and he derived from it a certain easily melodic and not infrequently folkloric and stereotypical vein.
In his best works, however, Opisso reveals an inspiration very similar to the pantheistic inspiration of Firpo, with in addition greater cultural and formal care.
See, for example, Spera…, which is written in Alcaic stanza, imitated according to the rules of Carduccian barbaric metrics.
Although perfectly aware of the Genoese literary tradition, as demonstrated, for example, by Ciæebelle – which obviously refers back to the Chiarabella of Cavalli – Opisso, in an era hardly suited to sweeping claims and experimentalism, preferred to take refuge more often than not in a type of poetry that was minor and burlesque, and often rhetorically devoted to the exaltation of city glories, yet not without effect.
His poetic texts are collected in L’Isoa (1951).
Though Opisso’s poetry always remains at a dignified level, it retains traces of its original ties to the world of Canson zeneise, apparent in the ease of rhyme, the pursuit of singable rhythms and sentimental themes.
Opisso sometimes approached social themes, as in these two dry, tense, no-frills sonnets, where the outrage and emotion do not fall into the melodramatic, except perhaps for the second triplet of the second sonnet.
L’òmmo do sacco, in the most common sense, is one of those bogeymen used to keep children quiet when they throw tantrums.
Another favorite theme of Opisso: escapism, the flight to distant, undefinable lands, away from everyday life; in search, perhaps, of arcane truths or a more authentic meaning of life.
Opisso sometimes attempts the construction of the ethereal, stylistically elegant image, in keeping with the poe tics of fragmentism in vogue in his day.
A sonnet that may be distantly reminiscent of the similar composition L’esile pesco al marzo che lo allaccia by F. Pastonchi, once housed in all school anthologies, but perhaps marked by a greater concreteness, uniquely Ligurian.
Antonio Leale (1936–2014)
Antonio Leale, a Genoese who spent his youth in the Upper Arroscia Valley locality, composed in the dialect of Pieve di Teco his unpublished collection Scannabaggi e perdidì, in which an acute penetration into the mentality of the peasant world is combined with the painful perception of the evil of living.
A photographer by profession, only belatedly did Leale graduate with a degree in psychology, and his interest in the workings of the psyche clearly shines through in his work.
Rather inclined to devalue his writings, Leale did not publish his poems and, as far as we know, his output has been lost except for the three poems published by F. Toso in his Letteratura genovese e ligure (Genoa, 1989-1991).
Rita Cuneo Narizzano Murialdi (1892–1973)
Rita Cuneo Narizzano Murialdi (1892-1973) was one of the first female authors of verse in Genoese of the 20th century; she was descended from a family of soldiers and artists and, having married twice, had acquired a network of cultural and literary relations, so much so that for many years she received writers, painters, sculptors and other intellectuals at her villa in Priaruggia.
A remarkable sportswoman, she succeeded in the most diverse disciplines, in fencing as well as swimming, and was even a champion in horse riding and tennis.
In short, in everything an extraordinary woman, and it was therefore to be expected that the theme of the female condition would emerge in her poems, which in fact often deal with it.
Fiorenzo Toso writes that “The theme of discouragement over a frustrating female condition, which does not fulfil the author’s desires and ambitions, is constantly present in Rita Cuneo’s poetry, in verses often tinged with bitter pessimism». [1] For his part, Leonida Balestreri had written: «a poetry that reflects all the light of an open soul, and all the impetus of a heart that does not ignore the throbbing of the clearest and most generous feelings”.[2]

Sergio Sileri (1919–1983)
Stark and dramatic was Sergio Sileri’s (1919-1983) conception of life, that of a man who was put to the test in the docks, in the factories and finally in the offices of a Genoa very different from today’s and much harsher, seeing his Christian faith, his hopes and illusions clash with harsh reality.
But, in the end, what keeps us alive and gives us the strength to go on will always be love, “the only root of eternal being / the blood to live beyond death”.
Belonging to that vein of committed Ligurian poetry, which even begins with the so-called Genoese Anonym, passes through Paolo Foglietta and Luigi Pedevilla, and arrives up to the present day with authors such as Giannoni and De André, Sileri describes a city deeply in crisis; as a Genoese man and a man of the sea, he is saddened and annoyed at the city’s decadence due to the greed for money and the misguidedness – especially of the young, “protesters of the boat and the boatswain” – cares that make us forget the really important things in life: “he who comes does not know / the patience of the strong / the toil of the dead”.
Thus, the ship Elettra will be torn to pieces in the name of money, because men forget “glory and abandonment / joy and pain” along with their own dignity and “the boast of work accomplished”, so much so that the poet exclaims: “blessed are the dead who have given nothing / who at least are forever in peace”.
Towards the end of his life and his spiritual itinerary, Sileri relied even more on the hopes offered by religion, but without ever really succeeding in silencing his personal torment.
He was also a highly appreciated actor in the Genoese theatre, and many remember him for his expressive and deep voice, which seemed to be made especially for reading poems, his own and others’, and highlighting their dramatic meaning.
The description of Genoa as a “seaport”, which to others would perhaps have offered the occasion for sterile nostalgia and yielding to stereotyped depictions, becomes in Sileri the source of more general considerations on the vanity of human endeavour; not even the proverbial honesty and straightforwardness of the Genoese can be trump cards any more.
The illusions of childhood compared with the bitter realisation of adulthood are soberly sketched here.
The poet’s preoccupation with the decadence of the city went hand in hand with his anguish for a youth that was demonstrating a disturbing moral and psychological weakness and sinking into the aberrations of drugs, alcohol, extremist politics, the terrorism of the “anni di piombo”, if not into the coils of common delinquency.
Sileri did not deal with these topics explicitly, but as a true poet by means of allusions and suggestive images.
Typical of Sileri is a moral rigorism, which perhaps draws its origins from that vein of essentially practical and sombre religiosity, present throughout the history of Genoa, characteristic of those who are always ready to lose their possessions and their lives at sea, but also influenced by rivulets of Jansenism, which can still be found in the thought of Mazzini and Eustachio Degola (who, let us not forget, was the Genoese priest responsible for Manzoni’s conversion to Catholicism, but indeed in an almost heretical context).
The condemnation of human blindness to sin, in a poem like this, sometimes takes on biblical prophet-like tones, going far beyond what have always been the limits of “dialectal” poetics.
Even the story of the ship Elettra becomes the occasion for a broader discourse on human ingratitude, on the insensitivity of the new times to the values of work, self-denial and sacrifice.
Beyond all the problems, sufferings and obstacles of life, there remains Christian hope, reaffirmed by Sileri in three effective gnomic couplets.
Roberto Giannoni (1934–2016)
As an executive of the Italian national broadcaster RAI, Giannoni spent most of his life away from Genoa.
He began his poetic activity in Italian, but only in Genoese did he find a personal and authentic voice, searching in the subconscious, in the dungeons of the soul, for things he otherwise would not have dared to say.
In regards to Giannoni critics have spoken of “antilyrical poetry”[1], but perhaps it would be more correct to say that it is a poetry that refuses the abandonment to song, to the most blatant display of sentiment.
In fact, feeling is as much present as it is restrained, and the poet is here like a musician playing mutedly.
In terms of language, too, Giannoni delves into a kind of collective town memory, with special predilection for the commercial and business bourgeoisie of yesteryear, trying to reproduce their profile, manner of expression, mentality, in the context of a fundamental pessimism about human nature, whose fate is in any case decay and annihilation, even – in the long run – in the memories of those who remain.
[1] F. Brevini, Le parole perdute, p.374, Einaudi, Turin, 1990.
Similarly to what we have observed in the poetry of Sileri, in Giannoni too we see the emergence of a link with a typically Ligurian religiosity, conflicted and complex, with Jansenist and rigorist overtones, which has at its basis a desire to emancipate oneself from the slavery of money and matter, along with the impossibility of escaping from it.
Compare this short poem with L’ægua a l’é storbia by Guidon, which develops an essentialy similar theme – the indifference of nature in the face of human suffering – but with profoundly different outcomes. Whereas in Guidoni some hope of redemption represented by love survives, Giannoni only emphasizes the incomprehension on the part of the natural world and almost its foolishness.
The recording of naturalistic fact, which Giannoni would like to be cold and objective, never lacks, in reality, a heartfelt personal participation in the missed fates of so many unhappy people.
A traditional theme in Genoese poetry, the fish market, which has always offered stereotypical and folkloric cues, here becomes a kind of metaphor for the human world destined for death and dissolution.
There have been those who, with regard to this text, have spoken of an «anatomist’s gaze» (F. Brevini) that is cold and rational, but the author’s symbolic intent appears evident in the use of similes (pan vellui de gexa), in the underthought of certain telling words (çimitëio, dormitöio, mortöio), in the morgue-like atmosphere that informs the entire composition.
In Giannoni we find – in accordance with the author’s literary views – singular revisitations in a “low” key of fundamental myths of humanity: Odin, Theseus and Ariadne, the characters of the Iliad, Oedipus, sometimes mixed with elements taken from Italian melodrama (Butterfly) and with exotic scenarios (Conrad). Not to parody them, but to emphasize the universality of such myths and perhaps the decadence of values into which the modern world has plunged.
Also to be noted in this poem is Giannoni’s singular concept of sexuality as that of a desire to rest from life, indeed that of the end of life, another name for death.
[2] guercia: slang term for “vulva”; here in obvious relation to the protagonist’s mutilation.
[3] ch’o cammiña: rough translation of Wanderer, traditional appellation of Odin.
Philosophical or existential themes are also developed by Giannoni by resorting to terms and similes drawn from everyday life, common to the experience supposedly belonging to those who speak the “dialect” on a daily basis.
Although Giannoni declared himself an enemy of “lyric” poetry, nevertheless he also wrote some texts that can safely be made to fall into that category.
Cesare Vivaldi (1925–1999)
Cesare Vivaldi was born in Imperia, and moved in 1933 to Rome, where he completed his studies. He was a reporter and political journalist for Milano Sera, head of the Rome bureau of Ora in Palermo, editor of Italia Domani and Tempo Presente, art critic of Avanti!, lecturer in art history at the Academies of Fine Arts first in Naples and then in Rome, and a well-known poet in Italy and abroad.
Vivaldi arrived at the use of the local idiom in the search for a means of expression that was free from all literary suggestions, within the neorealist climate that characterized the years of his poetic debut.
The language that Vivaldi developed, writes F. Toso[1], “does not reflect the tongue of Porto Maurizio, except in the most conspicuous aspects of phonetics”, and therefore, “precisely because it is not precisely localizable, it responds to the needs of experimentation and to a literary game of the finest texture”.

Giuseppe Cassinelli (1928–2017)
Cassinelli was born in Dolcedo (Imperia). A keen scholar of 20th-century Ligurian poets and a very fine literary critic, he edited, among other things, the Pascoli-Novaro, Ettore Serra-Titta Rosa, Boine-Novaro correspondence. Worthy of mention are also his studies on Aldo Capasso, Giovanni Boine and the poets of La Riviera Ligure, as well as the edition of all the poems of Mario Novaro.
Reserved and introverted, his rare and precious poetic work in the tongue of his native village can be roughly likened to that of Edoardo Firpo, in terms of the almost childlike astonishment the author expresses before the world of nature and the flow of life, and the aptitude for transfiguring the landscape in tune with states of mind.
Unlike Firpo, however, Cassinelli’s inspiration is characterized by a very firm faith in God.
If one compares this text with F. Rostan’s A puira, one can see how an essentially identical state of mind is expressed here in a manner that’s far more cunning and phonically well thought out.
Bruna Pedemonte (1963)
Originally from Valpolcevera, she retains a bit of Cremeno’s accent, memories of her very early childhood and the use of a Genoese dialect – she says – that is a bit “uncouth”.
She grew up in Biscione, a neighborhood that, in spite of its bad reputation, actually has a rural character, for better or worse.
She has been writing poetry since childhood.
She perceives writing as a necessity, a way to better master her emotions.
Her first poem was written in Genoese, but then for years she composed in Italian.
Suddenly, the “father language” resurfaced and she started writing again in her “language of the heart”.
For a long time, she did not consider sharing what she calls “a solitary exercise” with anyone until, thanks to a small booklet entitled Ciæi de lunäio in which she had collected her poems from 2010, she was persuaded by dear friends to defy her reluctance and open up to the outside world.
Thus, she published several of her poems in several issues of Alba Letteraria – a magazine edited by the Lercari library – and was offered the opportunity to have a column entitled Spegetti bleu in the newspaper “Secolo XIX” as part of the “Parlo Ciæo” page.
Her poetic language is essential, pictorial, evocative.
For our part, we might add that the author has perhaps derived from her Buddhist faith an ability to fix sensations in an immutable instant, to turn them into matter for meditation.
Of note is how the underlying feminist demands here do not translate into pedantic sociological dissertations, but rather into images that are fresh, natural, immediate, but not obvious; almost coming from a pre-industrial civilization and on balance optimistic.
Andreina Solari (1956)
Andreina Solari was born in Chiavari. After studying accounting, she took a major interest in reading, writing and painting.
She is currently councilor at the municipality of Leivi with responsibility for education and culture, and she is promoter and president of the National Poetry Prize in Italian and Genoese.
She is a member of the Dialectal Cultural Center “O Castello de Ciävai” in Chiavari. She is a juror for the International Prize “Echi di Poesia Dialettale” (BN) sponsored by UNESCO.
For the past several years she has dedicated herself to the study of the Genoese language with special attention to the recovery of lost words.
She is part of the Genoese Group that writes a page, Parlo Ciæo, in the local language every Sunday for the newspaper “Il Secolo XIX”.
Andreina Solari’s poetry in Genoese draws inspiration most often from memories and moods related to the past, which provoke reflections and meditations on human existence and destiny.
Of the numerous awards she has received for her literary activity, we recall above all the 1st Prize “Marengo d’Oro” at the International Literary Competition “Ida Baruzzi Bertozzi” (Chiavari 2010), 1st Prize “Eridanos” (dialectal short story, Gussola 2013), 1st Prize for dialectal poetry “G. Orengo” (Imperia 2016), 1st Prize “O Leudo” (Sestri Levante 2016).
As part of the project of the Istituto d’Istruzione Superiore Grottaminarda and the Istituto Comprensivo San Tommaso D’Aquino (AV), she was awarded Author of the Year 2017 with for her short story Lo schiocco del merlo.
Erica Autelli of the University of Innsbruck wrote of her, “In her poetry interwoven with everyday life excerpts surface; the age of games, of youth, of affection, but above all, an intimate and suffered love for her region and her sea shines through: a ‘ligurianness’ rooted in her with its colors, the serenity of the olive hills, the enchantment of nature and the beauty of the coast”.
Roberto Benso (1939)
Benso was born in Carrosio. He is a graduate of the University of Genoa with a degree in economics and an officer in the Alpini, and he worked in information technology and business organization, up to management levels.
As a writer, he has dealt mainly with history, art, and the agrarian landscape of Genoa and the Oltregiovo region.
He has authored some forty volumes and about seventy essays and monographs. For many years he edited the magazine “In Novitate”.
In 2001 he was among the winners of the Ignazio Buffa literary prize, announced by the Urbense Academy of Ovada; in 2013 he was awarded the “Press Prize” of the City of Tassarolo; in 2014 he was among the finalists of the “Premio Nazionale di Narrativa Alpina – Alpini sempre”.
Between 2015 and 2016 he authored the documentary films San Marino, Insediamento dei Capitani Reggenti and La battaglia di Novi del 15 agosto 1799.
Benso’s poems, written in the dialect of Carrosio, are collected in E föe do ferguò (2023) and were inspired by the idea of helping to save the memory and culture of a community, which nowadays has almost disappeared. Beyond the obvious ethnographic interest, not infrequently Benso, unraveling the ball of his memories, arrives at an authentic lyrical intensity, which is noteworthy.
It seems to us that his poems stand to show how even in the mind most structured by familiarity with science, with technology, and with rational thought – which has informed his whole life – there always remains a link with childhood and with roots, which can never be totally ignored, but at a certain moment demands to emerge, to come out into the open.
