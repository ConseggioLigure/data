Anthology of Ligurian literature
The Council has compiled an anthology of Ligurian literature edited by Alessandro Guasoni.
Readers will get a glimpse of the gradual evolution of Genoese and Ligurian literature over the centuries, both in terms of language and content. From the civic-epic poetry of the Genoese Anonym and Foglietta, to the Baroque and Gongorist inspiration of Cavalli; from the comic poetry of Piaggio, to the intimate, pastoral lyricism of Firpo – all literary movements are presented and together comprise a rich corpus that remains enjoyable to read today.

12th–13th century
In the 12th and 13th centuries, the educated elite still wrote literary and official texts in Latin.
The Annals by Caffaro, an account of the thwarted threat posed by Frederick Barbarossa, were written in Latin, as was the Chronica civitatis ianuensis by Iacopo da Varagine, which recounts the victories of Meloria (1284) against the Pisans and Laiazzo (1294), against the Venetians. The Legenda aurea, also by da Varagine, depicts the lives of saints, often wondrous and filled with miracles.
The poets of Provençal expression are also important, as this language was used by troubadours in Genoa and other parts of Italy, and was second only to Latin in terms of cultural importance. Among them, we remember Lanfranco Cigala, Bonifacio Calvo, Luchetto Gattilusio. Towards the end of the 12th century, it was a Provençal, Raimbaut de Vaqueiras, who first used Genoese in a literary context – albeit in jest – in his Altercation with a Genoese woman.
The first inscription in Genoese on a tombstone dates from 1259, while a Crusade song, which exhibits the first evidence of independent literary use, dates from 1269.
The Genoese vernacular only fully asserted itself with the work of the Genoese Anonym, who lived at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries. The Genoese Anonym is considered the first among our poets, animated by great political, patriotic, and religious passion.
14th–15th century
In the 14th and 15th centuries, Genoa frequently struggled with internal strife and was at times subjected to foreign domination by France or Milan. However, Genoese was increasingly used in private writings and official documents. Genoese religious texts, often translated from French (originally translated from Latin), proliferated. The Questioim de Boecio was a Genoese version of De consolatione philosophiae originating from the French translation by Jean de Meung.
An encomiastic style also developed from Central Italian models, at times diverging from the norm. We can count among this edificatory literature the Tratao de li VII pecai mortali by Jerome of Bavaria. These hagiographical texts also include the works of Luca Paterio, and other anonymous writers such as the author of the Istoria de lo complimento de lo mondo and Croniche e overe de papi e imperaoi. The texts recount the stories of the magician Merlin and King Arthur, adapted from the “materia di Bretagna” and the life of Charlemagne from the “Carolingian cycle”.
Other chronicles of saintly deeds include the Miraculi de la biâ vergem sancta Maria, which stands out for the anonymous author’s digressions that occasionally develop into tales of mystery and horror.
De Barllam et Jossaffà, a Christianised version of the life of Buddha, is also noteworthy. Other hagiographic and moral treatises include Lo libero de frai Gillio, a translation of the Dicta Beati Aegidii, attributed to a companion of St Francis, and the Via de lo Paraiso with advice to women on how to be “good” wives.
The first known author from Savona appears: Alerame Traversagni, with his vernacularisation of the Legenda de Sancta Elizabeth of 1455.
Biagio Assereto’s letter and report on the battle of Ponza (1435) was written in Genoese at a time when Genoa was under Milanese rule.
In the second half of the 15th century, Genoese writing showed a progressive decline as it was gradually influenced by Tuscan due to the rising fame of Italian literature.
In 1473 the first calendar in Genoese appeared, titled La raxone de la Pasca, which was also the first printed text published in Liguria.
16th century
The 16th century was dominated politically by the figure of Andrea Doria, and in literary terms, by Foglietta’s “reform” against the prevailing Tuscanization of the time. This is evinced in various songs extolling one lordship or another as Liguria experienced constant turnover of power, with consequent revolts, massacres and invasions. The Opera e lamento de Zena che tracta de la guerra et del saccho dato per gli Spagnoli (1522) is exemplary of this trend.
In the end, Doria emerged victorious from the upheaval, with his astute tactics of alliances and his reform of the state, while in literature, Foglietta restored a relatively archaic language, seeking to give the Genoese language back its relative autonomy and political significance.
Noteworthy poets in 16th century Genoese have been handed down to us through the collection Rime diverse in lengua zeneize, reprinted several times throughout the century. After Foglietta, a poet of both lyrical and social and political inspiration, come Barnaba Cigala Casero, Benedetto Schenone, and a poet of uncertain identity. All were to varying degrees Petrarchists, but Cigala was also the initiator of the custom of encomiums in verse for the election of Doges.
The works of Vincenzo Dartona – translator of the first canto of Orlando Furioso – and of Bernardo Castelletto are also notable.
In the face of the expansion of the Tuscan language, certain official prose traditions continued, such as the speeches of Doge Matteo Senarega, on the occasion of the end of his term of office and to greet Prince Gio. Andrea Doria on his return with the fleet.
17th century
During the so-called “Century of the Genoese”, named for the spectacular wealth accumulated by Genoa’s patrician families and the splendor of their palaces, Ligurian literature saw the triumph of conceptualism and the Baroque style. Names to remember include Giuliano Rossi, Pantaleo Grimaldi Murassana, Gio. Francesco Baffico, Fulgenzio Baldani, Pier Giuseppe Giustiniani and others, but above all Gian Giacomo Cavalli. It is Cavalli who acclimatized Liguria to the contemporary European experiences of culteranismo, supported by an exceptional patron in the upper echelons of Italian literature, Savona-born Gabriello Chiabrera.
Theater underwent great development in 17th-century Genoa; the meeting of the Commedia dell’Arte with that of academic theater led to scripts written fully or partially in Genoese (in essence, multilingual comedies).
However, lack of outside comprehension of the Ligurian language made it necessary to translate the Genoese parts, or suppress them, for productions outside Liguria.
Prominent playwrights included Anton Giulio Brignole Sale, Francesco Maria Marini, Giovanni Andrea Spinola, Pier Giovanni Capriata and Giovanni Agostino Pollinari.
In the second half of the century, a slow political and economic decline began. Between Piedmontese plots to seize the Republic, the increased influence of France, and various other factors, the independent Genoese cultural identity was gradually diminished. Carlo Andrea Castagnola’s work, which deals with the bombardment of Genoa by the French fleet and the city’s proud, stoic perseverance, constitutes a momentary revival of patriotic and civic themes.
The first poets in Ligurian appear along the Riviera, Stefano Rossi of Taggia and Paolo Agostino Orengo of Ventimiglia – albeit with only burlesque intentions.
18th century
The events of 1746 were followed by a strong revival of civic and patriotic poetry, with a large part of Stefano De Franchi’s work dedicated to the uprising against the Austrians and Balilla’s deed. Other notable authors who dealt with the subject include the anonymous authors of Trionfo dro popolo zeneise and Libeaçion de Zena, and above all Gaetano Gallino, with his Cadeña Zeneise.
In the meantime, since the beginning of the century, a number of poets in the Rivieras and hinterland had begun expressing themselves in the local dialects, such as Luca Maria Capponi of Triora, Gian Lorenzo Federico Gavotti of Sassello, and Luciano Rossi of Campoligure.
The 18th century was also the century in which scholars directed by De Franchi translated Tasso’s Jerusalem Delivered.
Other noteworthy poets, after De Franchi, are Ambrogio Conti and other unknown writers responsible for the Canto Unico, a manuscript preserved in the library of the Società Economica of Chiavari, or the flyers that frequently celebrated current events. On one such flyer was Toralbo Armonico’s poem on Captain Maglione, which celebrated the victories of the Ligurian navy.
With the arrival of Napoleon and the end of the Oligarchic Republic, we see the appearance of (supposedly) popular poets who, under pseudonyms, sing the praises of the new political direction; we recall “Cittadino Piceda” and “Baciccia Degradao”, and a Dialogue imagined by a certain Antonio Durazzo between two patricians, temporarily imprisoned in the Hall of the Minor Council, who cannot fathom that their rule has ended.
On the other hand, there was the poet Antonio Pescetto, of Genoese origin but a resident of Savona: initially he sang of the city’s nobility. After the Revolution, he devoted himself to celebrating the Democratic Republic and patriotic festivities, only to then sing the praises of the Savoyard governor after the annexation by Piedmont.
19th century
The 19th Century was that of the annexation of Liguria by Piedmont, after the Congress of Vienna (1815), which was not very agreeable to the Ligurians. It was also the century of the Italian Risorgimento. It began with the work of Martino Piaggio, the famous author of the Lunario del Signor Regina, a moderate and prudish cantor of the bourgeoisie, who did not, however, lack a little social satire and a naive faith in progress.
After Genoa lost political autonomy, its literature gradually descended into folklorism, comic poetry, a certain populism; only fleeting traces of its more substantial tradition remained.
In 1835, unknown anti-monarchists revived and updated a theatrical parody from Metastasio, Achille in Sciro, which had previously been performed at the turn of the previous century in protest against the oligarchy.
Among the authors of lunar almanacs, Stefano Parodi, who was even more reactionary than Piaggio, should be remembered. Among the torchbearers of the Reginian almanac, but with liberal ideas, were Luigi Doria, Luigi Domenico Farina, Giambattista Vigo, Andrea Pollano, and Giovanni Casaccia, who authored a famous Genoese-Italian dictionary.
Another noteworthy almanac author was the liberal priest Luigi Pedevilla, who for many years carried on the Lunäio do Sciô Tocca.
Playwrights included Federico Alizeri and Luigi Persoglio.
Works on celestial themes were published in Savona, too, with O Canocciale de Savoña and O microscopio e telescopio. Among its poets were Francesco Rocchino, Francesco Pizzorno, Andrea Rocca, Agostino Bruno, Filippo Noberasco (father and son), Francesco Marengo.
Among the authors of the Risorgimento, we then recall Luigi Stallo in Genoa, who in 1853 wrote Vixon d’un emigrou italian (vision of an Italian emigrant), ardently patriotic and with a Mazzinian spirit. Among the comic poets who found themselves in the columns of the magazine O Successo, on the other hand, we recall Pietro Galliano and Aurelio Capponi.
In the second half of the century, a vast production of journalistic prose also proliferated, and periodicals such as O Balilla and O Stafî published investigations and reports. Furthermore, historical novels and pieces on current events were written by Edoardo Michele Chiozza and Giuseppe Poggi.
However, the poet commonly considered the most representative of the second half of the 19th century is Nicolò Bacigalupo, with whom literature in the Genoese language turns decisively towards comedy and parody. It is relegated to a subordinate role to Italian literature, including in the theatrical sphere: Bacigalupo is in fact the author of the first and most famous of Govi’s comedies.
20th century
The mixture of customs, people and mentalities due to the two World Wars, the unpredictable development of the means of communication and transport, the expansion of trade and the economy on a global scale – these factors caused local languages such as Ligurian to regress as never before. The recession of local languages provoked a resistance against the feeling of cultural erasure felt by many people. Philological studies of local languages, as well as surveys of prose and poetry, resulted as a reaction.
Among the Novecento authors, but still linked in many respects to the 19th century, mention must be made of Carlo Malinverni, Federico Gazzo, Alessandro Monti; comic and sketch production continues with Aldo Acquarone, Giambattista Rapallo (Baciccia); somewhere in between were the Savona anarchist printer Giuseppe Cava, the Genoese Ettore Chiappe, Augusto Tessada, Filippo Angelo Castello, Marino Merello, Nora Massa; towards a partial renewal – Italo Mario Angeloni, Francesco Puppo, Alfredo Gismondi, Carlo Domingo Adamoli, Alberto Boccaleone, Pietro Lombardo and G. B. Costa, Luigi Poggi. In 1930, the journalist Arturo Salucci published an anthology of sonnets in Genoese, where one can find traces of the production of often unknown, occasionally interesting authors.
Authors linked, in one way or another, to Govian theater were Emerico Valentinetti, Ugo Palmerini, Sabatino Lopez, while others remained strangers to it, such as Emilio Del Maestro, Luigi Anselmi, Oliviero Olivari, Emilio Tixi, Norberto Sopranzi.
A singular experiment is the lyrical work Scheuggio Campaña, with verses by Aldo Martinelli, Emanuele Canesi and Giovanni Monleone.
The most significant poet of the first half of the 20th century remains Edoardo Firpo, although his primacy is sometimes questioned.
In the meantime, production in the other Ligurian dialects has expanded somewhat, with the works of Filippo Rostan, from Ventimiglia, Louis Notari, from Monaco, Marcel Firpo, from Menton, Gin De Stefani and Vincenzo Jacono, both from San Remo, all presented in the pages of the neo-Felibrist magazine A Barma Grande.
Among the La Spezia poets we must name Ubaldo Mazzini, among the Oltregiogo poets Ettore Zunino and Angelo Daglio, and among the Alassio poets, Ettore Morteo, in Ovada Colombo Gajone.
In the post-World War II period, a revival of civic themes, attested in the booklets relating to the Lauro d’Oro competition, was accompanied by the movement of Firpo’s imitators, who were inclined to think that he was the only lyric poet in Genoese poetic history. Some even had interesting results, almost superior to those of the master himself, such as Sandro Patrone and Vito Elio Petrucci; along the same lines were Roberto Della Vedova, Antonio Canepa, Flora Mancini, Luigi Cornetto.
Other lyric poets outside the Firpo line were Guido Nilsen, Silvio Opisso, Rita Cuneo, Rosita Del Buono from Savona, Mario Lertora and Piero Bozzo.
In the 1970s, with the increased interest at a national level for literature in “dialect”, a flourishing of poets of various inspirations can also be observed in Liguria, such as Giuliano Balestreri, Sergio Sileri, Angelo De Ferrari, Ernesto Pisani, Emma Midolo, Jean Aicardi, Pia Bandini, Giovanni Ghione, Giorgio Grassi, Rodolfo Badarello, Mario Accornero, Armando Giorgi, Luciano Caprile; Among the most significant names that emerged between the 1960s and 1980s were Plinio Guidoni, who was also active as a playwright, and Roberto Giannoni, both of whom were involved in a profound transformation of literature in the Genoese language and became known nationally.
As far as Riviera poetry is concerned, mention must be made of Cesare Vivaldi, from Imperia, who started out from post-World War II neo-realism to arrive at a modern lyricism; Giuseppe Cassinelli from Dolcedo, Pietro Baccino from Giusvalla, Renzo Villa, Andrea Capano and Dionisio Bono from Ventimiglia, Franco D’Imporzano from Sanremo, Eugenio Giovando, Eugenio Lubrano and Renzo Fregoso from La Spezia, Paolo Bertolani from Serra di Lerici, Livio Gianolla from Arcola, Bruno Rombi from Calasetta, Maria Pia Viale from Vallebona, Natalino Trincheri, Carlo Costa from Chiavari.
Prose, too, has undergone a certain development, starting with the tales and anecdotes of Guido Pastor from Buggio, to the Sestresi tales and fables of Elsa Pastorino Alloisio, and the other anecdotes with an everyday theme collected by Maria Terrile Vietz.
The theater has had its share of new authors as well, recognized by the Anna Caroli prize; among them are the aforementioned Plinio Guidoni, and others such as Enrico Scaravelli, Gianni Poli, Enrico Berio.
21st century
One quarter of the new century has already gone by, and it has begun with the disappearance of some of the most significant names of the previous century, such as Petrucci, Patrone and Giannoni.
Other authors, who had emerged shortly after, took the premises of their poetry to new depths, and they are Fiorenzo Toso, Alessandro Guasoni and Daniele D. Caviglia. In recent years, Bruna Pedemonte, Andreina Solari, Danila Olivieri, Anselmo Roveda, Enrica Arvigo, reggae singer and “street poet” Marco Carbone and Maria Pia Viale of Vallebona have also gained prominence.
The spread of computer technology has also seen the emergence of attempts and experiments to foster knowledge of the Ligurian language on the Wweb, but the ever-increasing decline in the living practice of the language has led to doubts, discussions and disputes over issues of lexicon and spelling, which once would not have been imaginable, but which in any case testify to the survival of a certain public interest in these issues.
A resurgence of interest is also evidenced by attempts to disseminate prose publicity, such as the Parlo Ciæo page of the newspaper Secolo XIX, directed by Andrea Acquarone, and his magazine O Stafî, which was inspired by the periodicals in Genoese of the second half of the nineteenth century.

Instructions to Sigurano
Evidence of the use of the Genoese vernacular by the Municipal Chancellery appears as early as the first half of the 14th century.
Genoese became the official written language alongside (but in a very subordinate position to) Latin, as the various magistracies of the state continuously used the same vernacular at a spoken level.
Spotorno (1821) names one Antonio Cavanna, a jurist and politician who was a very famous orator in Genoese between 1390 and 1430.
Political instructions, addressed by the Commune of Genoa to Sigurano, to defend Genoa’s interests in Famagusta before the King of Cyprus date back to the mid 14th century. The Fathers of the Commune, with the instructions, provide Sigurano with an outline of what he should say to the King, should the latter show himself contrary to the interests of Genoa and the merchants in Cyprus.
Questions from Boethius
The 14th century is the time of the institution of the perpetual dogate, with the tragic figure of Simon Boccanegra, the first Doge, who tried to contain the discord between social classes, to curb the arrogance of nobles and plebeians, and died murdered in revenge by some of his own supporters. The presence of this translation from Boethius’ De consolatione philosophiae (via Jean de Meung’s French translation), with its exhortations to concord and its condemnation of the greed of men, does not seem out of place.
The descriptions of the natural world introduce the lyrical sense of the landscape – understood as a mirror of the human condition – into Genoese poetry for the first time. This has continued among our poets to the present day, to Firpo and even later, and in this way an echo of these verses has come down to us.
A poem about the divine order, to which all things tend entirely, without exception, suggests, like the entire translation from Boethius, that there might have been an audience in Genoa in a position to appreciate ancient philosophy and culture, and perhaps an interest in contemporary transalpine culture, given the frequency of borrowings from French.
The comparison of the word “gagieta” in verse 2, with “gabia” in verse 5, makes us realise that the “bi+vocal” nexus was already pronounced as “gi” in those days, and therefore what many times seem to be Italianisations of Old Genoese, are only due to the peculiarities of an etymological spelling.
This vice, of which the Genoese, mostly merchants, are often accused, must have been well present in the conscience of the men of those times. The general intonation is that of the moral poems of the Genoese Anonym.
Fiction in the 1300s
A hagiographic and moralising 14th-century tale, taken from the life of the Buddha via the Byzantine and Christianised. The story of Jossaffà is precisely that of Prince Siddhartha Gautama, locked up in a tower from an early age by his father, who was worried that he would come to know the sufferings and evils of the world; but once grown up, Jossaffà wants to know what lies outside his palace and, after much prayer, his father grants him this.
Among the countless numbers of treatises and chronicles written in fourteenth-century Genoese, one also finds a translation of the Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum (1277-78) by Martin of Troppau, where one can detect very timid attempts to “liberate a writing tradition that was otherwise strongly imbued with religious morality” (F. Toso).
The passage on the magician Merlin suggests a more widespread interest in chivalric literature in the Ligurian sphere than the surviving records would otherwise suggest.
Also in the Miraculi de la biâ vergen Sancta Maria one can observe here and there a desire to move away from hagiographic models in order to indulge more freely in the pleasure of storytelling, describing a lively world of knights, bourgeoisie and monks.
In the passage quoted here we are even faced with an embryo of a horror tale, where edifying motives actually take second place: narratives such as these are probably at the basis of Ligurian fairy tales and folk tales, characterised – as Italo Calvino observed – by a gothic, grotesque fantasy taste.
Religious lauds
Between the 14th and 15th centuries, a laudatory production of central Italian origin spread, partly based directly on the texts of Jacopone da Todi; the insistent calls for concord and expiation would seem to fit well with such a turbulent historical moment and a city torn apart by internal strife.
In this laud XVI, the poet’s attention is entirely focused on a single detail of the Passion scene, the thrust of the spear, and the situation is analysed from all points of view.
It should be noted that the name of the centurion Longinus in popular parlance, until a few years ago, had come to be identified with that of the devil.
Via de lo Paraiso (sec.
XV)
In the Via de lo Paraiso (“Way of Heaven”), the anonymous author offers young brides advice so that they can better cope with their new life with their husbands, made up of duties, renunciation, and submission.
We do not know to what extent the brides followed the advice, but the text is interesting as a document of custom, and of the mentality of an era.
La raxone de la Pasca (15th cent.)
La raxone de la Pasca is an incunabulum, of which only two copies are known, and it can boast several historical firsts: since it dates from 1474, it is the first printed text to have come out in Liguria, the first “lunäio” printed in this region, and one of the first in Italy.
It is not known for sure who wrote it, but in part it is an excerpt, translated into a kind of very Genoese vernacular, from two works by the humanist Jacopo Bracelli: the Descriptio Orae Ligusticae and the De claris Genuensibus Libellus.
The quotations, albeit apocryphal, from Dante, as well as the overall work, suggest a cultured person, perhaps a religious man, who in a veiled way takes a stand in the politics of his times, and La raxone fits into the strand of civil poetry that has characterized literature in Genoese from the beginning. According to F. Toso, “it represents one of the links that allow the reading of literary documents in Genoese according to that progression that allows them to be organized into an original ‘history’ of linguistic, cultural and, in a broad sense, artistic experiences”.
The anonymous author gives a description of the entire Ligurian Gulf, from Turbia to Cape Corvo, confirming that, then as now, these are the borders of Liguria.
This is followed by a eulogy of the illustrious Ligurians and their exploits, citing various examples of their courage and loyalty and self-sacrifice.
Confortatory of the Company of Mercy (1491)
The confortatory is a kind of manual for the lay brethren of the Company of Mercy, who accompanied those condemned to execution, and contains the outline of sermons to be given to prisoners to persuade them to confess and prepare for a peaceful end. The brethren could embellish the outline depending on the situation and the willingness of the condemned man.
The language is some of the most Tuscan-like, as was typical of that period.
These sermons come from different traditions, mostly foreign, and have continued to travel the world, so that they can be found scattered all over.
Note, as a curiosity, that the tale of the friar’s ecstasy at hearing the song of the bird sent by God forms the basis of a famous Milanese poem by Carlo Porta, Fraa Diodatt, who had found it in the book of moral examples Il prato fiorito by Giuseppe Ballardini, printed in Como in 1615.
Porta had taken it as a pretext for one of his ironic and anticlerical narratives.
Paolo Foglietta (16th cent.)
Paolo Foglietta, already considered the most important Ligurian language poets in his time, is still appreciated even by today’s critics, both for being the first to bring some order to the spelling and language after a long time when they had been abandoned to decadence, and for the lively political and moral passion of his poems.
And this is precisely what most strikes the reader today.
The use of the Genoese language, then, was for Foglietta an important part of his programme of restoration of ancient values; from his point of view, changes in language are a sign that customs are decaying: “it is no wonder already if we change languages and everything we do nowadays / because we are all used to making changes”, he says, and here the word “cangi” means both “changes” and exchange policies, bills of exchange; as if to say that changes in language are one and the same thing with the vice of making debts and living by usury, a life of parasites, which has nothing to do with the republican virtues of the ancient Genoese, as Foglietta saw them.
His poems are, for the most part, an attempt to rouse his fellow citizens from sloth, for the days of the greatness of Genoa, “mother of kingdoms and cities” were over.
Forced by the historical situation, even more so than by the wickedness of its citizens, the Republic was on its way to counting less and less on the world stage.
Beyond Foglietta’s civic commitment, we must also mention his skill as an artist, in the full meaning of this word; some sonnets contain moments that are almost impressionist paintings; the description of a barbarian attack on the Riviera is unforgettable, with women, men and children being captured to be made slaves; the anxiety, the fear of those poor people, the confusion of that situation are masterfully rendered.
Finally, we cannot forget the “Petrarch-inspired” Foglietta, with its most famous sonnet: Maitiña, the little girl capable of changing salt water into fresh water just by her presence.
Perhaps the most beautiful homage to feminine beauty in Genoese literature of all time.
[1] The poet alludes to the chains that closed off access to the Port of Pisa in the Middle Ages, brought to Genoa as a sign of triumph after the victory of Meloria (1283) and hung on the Porta Soprana.
De Franchi also alludes to them in one of his poems.
They were returned to the Tuscan city during the Fascist era, in a ceremony of reconciliation.
In this famous poem, the aristocratic divine figure of the Homeric poems, the rhododàktylos héos, the rose-fingered aurora, descends to our world and is embodied in a little girl of the people, Maitiña (“the morning”, perhaps a proper name in those days, just as in today’s world we can name a little girl “Aurora”)
The Genoese people’s indifference to poetry, to the common good, and above all their adoration of money and luxury are the object of Foglietta’s screeches.
In this other sonnet, Foglietta proposes his own remedy for unemployment, especially of the upper classes; if galleys were to be built, a trade – that of arms – could be given to the young men who went around Genoa “swinging fists”, without an education and without money, who were called “troublemakers” and had to be many, so that they may avoid prison, earn their keep and give lustre to the nation.
Foglietta compares Genoa with Venice and the comparison is all to the advantage of Genoa’s ancient adversary; Venice, a model of unity among citizens to be taken as an example, is the only Italian power that builds and maintains galleys to defend “half-dead” Italy and “the Holy Faith” against the Turks, although its citizens are perhaps poorer than the Genoese.
The word “virtue” – it is clear – should be understood in the Latin sense of “quality of being a man”; loyalty, courage, keeping one’s word, love for the common good, and not in the moralistic and sexual sense of “chastity”.
To a sonnet by the jurist Ambrogio Spinola, who urged him to write in Italian instead of Genoese, because in that way he could have surpassed Homer (according to one tradition, born in Smyrna) and Virgil (who was from Mantua), Foglietta replied as follows.
Benedetto Schenone (16th cent.)
Very little is known about him, except that he was blind and sang of a totally spiritual love, detached from all earthly experience.
For Benedetto Schenone, the love experience is mystical and religious, or even esoteric. In an abstract and allusive tone, the author speaks to us of Platonic love for an angelic woman, who guides man towards Paradise, like Dante’s Beatrice, or as in the Stilnovist poets. It could just be a literary game, although one cannot exclude physical consequences in this search for a superhuman reality.
Even the circumstance of the poet’s blindness could be thought symbolic and invented to give greater expressiveness to the condition of detachment from the senses that his poetry suggests.
The text gives the impression of being destined for a very refined aristocratic environment, educated in the reading of Petrarch and Dante, even more so than that of Foglietta and Cigala. By contrast, Schenone is also the author of two sonnets of comic intonation, which counterbalance the elevated spiritual and religious inspiration of his major poem, almost as if to play it down, and bring the reader back down to earth.
The thirteen love octaves are followed by two comic sonnets, where Schenone seems to want to show the other side of the coin of his love poetry, all cerebral, by transferring it to a low register.
Opera and lament of Genoa concerning the war and the sack by the Spaniards in the year 1522
In this text, the work of a poet who was a supporter of the Doria family, one can observe – according to F. Toso – “the attempt to arrive at a ‘Tuscan’ model of poetry; its stanzas of octosyllables represent a crude experiment to arrive at the Italian octave”.
The language is a Genoese disguised as “Tuscan” and represents the lowest point of the decadence that occurred from the mid-15th century onwards, hand in hand with the political decadence of Genoa.
The battle of Portofino (16th cent.)
This is the work of an anonymous poet – a supporter of the House of Doria – who was always ready to follow his masters and go along with them when they changed sides, as can also be seen in the song about the sack of Genoa in 1522. This other song about the Battle of Portofino in 1526 was written in support of the French, who the Doria were allied with at that time against the Spanish.
It would not be many years before the Doria would also leave these allies to side with Spain.
The sense of unity of a people that animated the poems of the Genoese Anonym has here disappeared completely, to give way to the celebration of a single family, while the Ligurian territory is only a battlefield.
The language is as decadent as can be imagined, and the classical allusions to Nero, Domitian, and the Trojans sound extravagant.
Mario Accornero (1921)
Accornero, a chemical engineer, was born in Savona, and since 1977 he’s lived in Sori in the Levante Ligure. He has dedicated his poetry collection I Canti do Gorfo (1988) to the Golfo Paradiso.
Despite the radiant beauty and luminosity of the places in which it is set, but perhaps because of that, Accornero’s poetry is interwoven with continuous references to death, and to the continuation of life in death and death in life, so that the shining landscape of the Riviera, motionless in memory, comes to represent well the motionless eternity of the world beyond.
In Accornero’s poetry, one is struck by the metrical construction, in which individual words are like the individual notes of a musical wave.
The tòpoi, the clichés of Genoese folklore and Ligurian poetry, even those of Firpo, become for Accornero a cause for meditation on the eternal, which is given a fable-like figuration: the crew of sailors storing up men’s dreams for the world beyond.
The oratory is that of St. Erasmus in Sori, and Accornero sees in it the symbol of continuity between the world of the living and the afterlife. Apart from adjectives that are too hasty or generic (“magical…”) the poet expresses well the idea that we all constitute as a conduit between the past and the future, between those who once were and those who will come in the distant future.
Carlo Domingo Adamoli (20th cent.)
Little is known about this author, who published in 1944 the collection of poems Reuse d’autunno. In the painful and anxiety-laden climate of the war, Adamoli developed a poetic vein steeped in pastoralism, a deep sense of nature and memories of time gone by.
The author fits perfectly into a crepuscular line that in Genoese and Ligurian counts several followers, including Firpo himself.
He often falls into too much sentimentality; however, it is regrettable that he did not leave us more texts, as his vein could have gone on to further development.
The gloomy climate of the war, the feeling of the imminent end of a world, undoubtedly affect these poems, infusing them with a whiff of decay and decay; many were written in anticipation of being set to music, hence the predilection for rapid, cadenced verse, frequently parisyllabic.
The interest in the misadventures and hopeless sufferings of simple people unites Adamoli with Firpo, albeit with different of aesthetic outcomes, since Adamoli – even in the sincerity of feeling – usually stops at a simple enunciation of existential pain.
An interest in the world of nature, of small animals, herbs and flowers, whose afflictions reflect the ills of human life, transferring into them our own feelings and hopes, is another element that unites Adamoli and Firpo, and constitutes their common source of inspiration.
Dionisio Bono (1934)
Under various metaphors, and sometimes under the veil of dreamlike imagination, at other times under the pretext of observing town or country reality, Ventimiglia’s Dionisio Bono speaks to us about life and its deceptions in order to hide from us the truth about our destiny and our path full of obstacles.
Federico Mario Boeri wrote of him, “Bono’s is a poetry that knows how to make us savor the simple joys of family, of authentic contact with nature; that fishes in the memories of a now distant youth, lived among people and things that are no more, but of which he knows how to find the scent in the somewhat ramshackle verses of an old nursery rhyme”.
He published In sciau (2008).
Antonio Canepa (1935–2012)
Antonio (Tonino) Canep was born and always lived in Pontedecimo, a town to which he was strongly attached, and self-published poems at his own expense or with the sponsorship of some friendly businesses.
We recall among his books, Unna voxe da-o mæ bòrgo (1990) and Amore se dixe amô (1992). His texts were all inspired by the feelings of love and friendship, including love for his land.
Marco Piaggio said of him “A very capable voice singing love for every woman, for every female creature, in the vicinity, but not within the border, of a much-loved city, Genoa…”.
Gian Giacomo Cavalli (1590–1658)
Gian Giacomo Cavalli is considered the greatest Ligurian language poet of all time; born towards the end of the 16th century and died in 1658, he presents us with all the virtues and all the defects of the Baroque age.
It is no coincidence that the peak of Ligurian poetry is reached with conceptualism, which in Italian – on the contrary – could only give rise to the insipid and lisping contortions of G.B. Marino and his followers.
Perhaps the Ligurian language, so concrete by nature, is more useful than Italian in expressing the most abstract and subtlest concepts, using everyday words and thus achieving, by contrast and short-circuiting, poetry; the same has been said of the English of Shakespeare and John Donne, whose metaphors and bold reasoning – according to some – would be out of tune outside their native tongue.
Baroque was born with the first great crises of the modern world; the thought of Pascal and Descartes, the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation sowed doubts in people of the time, who began to be tormented by the lack of meaning in life.
Cavalli speaks to us of this very modern anxiety, under the pretense of Petrarch’s poetry of love pains, in a perfect fusion of form and sentiment, where love passion is – it’s true – a pretext for writing a piece of bravura, but it cannot even be called truly false, since it takes on a truth of its own thanks to the poet’s art; we would like the description of the firefly even if Cavalli’s sufferings were all invented, because we all have, at some time or another, been thrown off balance here and there by fate or passion.
Cavalli also carries on the tradition of Doge encomiums, and even there he touches heights never before reached; for us it does not matter whether the princes that Cavalli sings of really deserved his praise; what matters are the figures still fresh and alive in his imagination: the ombrine, the bass, the bronco, the moray, the eels and the other fish that celebrated Giorgio Centurione’s election as Doge, playing “tricks and extravagances to amaze” in a seafaring fantasy that will live on in the reader’s memory.
In many cases, Cavalli’s songs echo the melodies of his fellow countryman and contemporary Gabriello Chiabrera, who demonstrated his high esteem of Cavalli on several occasions.
A puritanical horror of woman, vaguely counter-reformist and masochistic, appears in some of Cavalli’s verses, but one quickly realises that the description of love torments is also a pretext for his refined stylistic virtuosity.
In this famous ode for the election of Giorgio Centurione to the supreme magistracy of the Republic of Genoa, Cavalli deploys all his rhetorical and poetic skill, if poetry is also an extraordinary technical and linguistic ability in the construction of verse.
As Toso points out, “the whole imagery of the ode is in fact built on artificial images and metaphors where the evoked nature actually has very little space”.
But it could be said that the celebration of the Doge is a pretext for Cavalli to show off his mastery, although there is no lack of political stance in favour of the republican senatorial current, against the supporters of an absolutist change in the government of the state.
The doge is, in fact, for Cavalli and the republicans, the father of the people, and has been placed by God at the head of the Republic to lead in place of the people, to whom sovereignty is due, but who alone would not be able to exercise it.
But what really animates Cavalli’s poetry, beyond the subject matter, is always his quest for literary immortality, to procure a fame beyond death.
Daniele Domenico Caviglia (1956)
Caviglia is an electronic engineer, a lecturer at the Polytechnic School of the University of Genoa, author or co-author of numerous scientific articles in journals or accounts of international congresses. He has given expression to the more properly artistic and humanistic side of his personality through a poetry with a religious background that becomes a love song to humanity, in awareness of the evil always lurking in the folds of existence.
Novel images and similes of almost geometric and crystalline beauty characterize his verses.
As F. Toso writes, in Caviglia’s poetry we have “the representation of states of mind referring to tormented existential events […] in a songbook singularly suspended between the almost metallic coldness of an intellectualistic, polished verse and the sincere anxiety to convey emotions captured to inspiration in a moment of creative happiness”[1].
Landscape in Caviglia is barely hinted at, and his universe is symbolic, made up of abstract figures that nevertheless refer to concrete meanings in an assiduous search for the meaning of life.
The frequent allusions to human love seem here to recall a new Stilnovism, where the love lyric adumbrates these of an otherworldly reality.

Gabriello Chiabrera (16th–15th cent.)
The imaginative baroque author Chiabrera was one of the most famous poets of his time, and was the first to attempt to introduce the metres and stanzas of Greek and Latin poetry into Italian poetry. He was born in Savona in 1552, where he died in 1638. He was a friend of Cavalli and Grimaldi Murassana, and claimed that through poetry he wanted – like his compatriot Columbus in his geographical discoveries – “either to find a new world or perish”. He composed a number of songs in Ligurian, in which one finds the same bold experimentalism as in his Italian production.
He wrote the preface to the first edition of the Cittara Zeneise, in which he acknowledged Cavalli’s Ligurian genius, since “Liguria produces Troubadour men, and Troubadours of things never imagined and barely believed”.
Even if we are not quite sure that these “serenatas” are really the work of Chiabrera, they are certainly evidence of a local interest in Ligurian poetry, influenced by contemporary Genoese literature, which could not fail to find continuators in Ligurian literature in the centuries to come.
Luigi Domenico Farina (1831–1907)
Lawyer and prosecutor Luigi Domenico Farina, one of the most reputed of his time, was among the people who followed Piaggio in editing Lunäio do Sciô Regiña, whose compilation he oversaw between 1864 and 1876, after Giovanni Casaccia and Luigi Doria.
Of liberal and republican spirits like his contemporary Luggi Pedevilla and like his predecessor Giovanni Casaccia, he did not fail to satirize the Savoyard government from the pages of the almanac and to regret in verse “those fortunate times / when we were still republicans”.
Among his best-known works are La fiaba della bella Rosaspina and I sette Zuavi.
A primarily civil and political poet, he is to this day unpublished in volume and the poem we present here, of perennial relevance, is from the 1874 issue of Lunäio do Sciô Regiña.
Marcel Firpo (1876–1972)
Marcel Firpo, from Menton, was a man of considerable culture and a customs official, among the founders of the magazine “A Barma Grande” and between the two wars an open supporter of the union of the French coastal town with Italy.
For this reason, in the immediate postwar period he had to suffer – in addition to imprisonment and exile – oblivion by his fellow citizens, from which he began to emerge only in the last years of his life.
Firpo’s poetry – which at times, especially at the beginning of his career, falls into stereotypes and folklorism – draws its best results from a deep feeling for nature and a pantheistic-like identification with the mysteries of the land and the countryside, which the poet feels as part of himself and his life.
Among the territories that Victor Emmanuel II ceded to France in 1860, along with Nice and Savoy, Menton long retained an archaic Ligurian dialect, influenced by Provençal, Piedmontese, and the Nice dialect.
The poems written by Firpo after World War II show us a painful inner withdrawal of the poet, marked by his sad biographical vicissitudes, but with melancholy always clothed in an elegant classicism, as in this sonnet of impeccable Alexandrianism, where the measured and solemn intonation punctuates the inexorability of fate.
Domenico Garello (19th cent.)
Between 1812 and 1819, actor Domenico Garello presented a series of farces and parodies (with titles in either Italian or Genoese) at the Campetto and Falcone theaters, which featured the character “Signor Regina” as the protagonist. Amongst the comedies, Il Signor Regina alla Malapaga, Il matrimonio del Signor Regina con la Signora Lattuga, Le cantatrici di Bargagli e Regina capo dell’orchestra dei gobbi, Il convitato di pietra con Regina servo di Don Giovanni, Il signor Regina medico per forza, Regina servitore di due padroni, Regina atterrito dalle apparizioni and others.
Mr. Regina, before he was a theatrical character, had been a flesh-and-blood man, a vagabond originally from the Western Riviera, a certain a Francesco Cavanna, who earned his living by going around taverns and making people laugh, who would hand him a glass of wine and a piece of bread.
In 1792, at the age of forty, he died suddenly, completely drunk, falling down the stairs of an inn, and some suspicion had even arisen about this end of his life, which seemed suspicious.
But people had not forgotten him, and some actors, including Garello, had continued to play the character in plays even years later. Martino Piaggio, introducing his first Lunäio (1815), has him say this:
Perhaps Piaggio himself had collaborated on these little plays, especially writing the verses that often conclude individual scenes, to summarize their content; and later he, too, took up the character, modifying it again on the pages of his Lunäio, until he became the prototype of the common-sense and “old-fashioned” Genoese, a figure that returns over the years to the theater of the Bacigalupo, and from this into Govi’s.
Garello’s farces seemed lost, until, in the 1970s, Aidano Schmuckher discovered in the archives of the Museo del Risorgimento Le gelosie del Signor Regina, attributing them to Piaggio.
According to F. Toso, this play is instead the work of Garello, which for various reasons is more likely.
The writer of this note was able to attend (1977) what was perhaps the last staging of this play, directed by Cesare Viazzi, and performed by Nanni Raffo and Franco Paladini, two fine actors, who perhaps have been somewhat forgotten today.
Here we present the scene in which Mr. Regina meets (and clashes) with the other character of Genoese theater, the buffoonish Corporal, who here is called “Enrico” and pretends to be French due to the plot, with all the misunderstandings typical of this type of plays.
In this way, the old comedy of seventeenth-century multilingual theater is revived, with the misunderstandings that arise between speakers of two different languages.
It should be remembered that we are in the days when Genoa and Liguria belonged to the Napoleonic Empire, and occupying French soldiers, who were occasionally to be feared, would have frequently been seen in real life.
Livio Gianolla (1938)
Gianolla is from Arcola, and in the two volumes Dar castelo au razao (1981) and Lungo vota e vioi (1988) he described the peasant life of his village – a life that is disappearing – and its characters, without any idealization, but trying to preserve its memory for what it was. In fact, Gianolla, already from the first glimpses of what we now call “fluid” reality, felt that the ground was missing under his feet, because all that world of certainties, that solid ground, which for centuries had been the basis of village life, was gradually crumbling and giving way to artificial social relations, to a life with no more safety net, with no safe harbors.
Gianolla’s poetry is thus to be interpreted – says F. Toso – as “the defense against the assaults of time on something that is still alive and palpitating”.
Something, we may add, that decays and degrades inadvertently, along with everything else in the world.
In these poems, the enamored description of the Ligurian landscape transcends and unites with the memories of a father and a whole life dedicated to work and duty to family.
Alfredo Gismondi (1874–1965)
Gismondi was a pediatrician, a scholar of Genoese, its spelling and pronunciation. He compiled a Genoese-Italian dictionary, (S.E.I. 1955).
He published the following collections of poetry: Da-o mæ barcon (Genoa, 1942), Arvî e giöxìe (Genoa, 1954) and In faccia a-o nòstro mâ (Genoa, 1955).
A composedly descriptive writer, Gismondi can effectively render the landscape of the coast and hinterland, which becomes an occasion for quiet reflections, gracefully expressed.
He also wrote an erudite Prospectus of Ligurian Flora, and his knowledge of botany stands out from his poems in the care he employs in the nomenclature of Ligurian herbs and plants.
He also translated into Genoese the first book of Horace’s Epistles, using an approach similar to that of the eighteenth-century translators of Jerusalem Delivered.
Gismondi’s botanical knowledge emerges in a series of short lyrics dedicated to the shrubs, plants and flowers of the Ligurian hinterland, again in verse from which the author’s fine classical education shines through.
Mario Grossi (20th cent.)
Mario Grossi wrote, in the dialect of Bolano – an archaic Ligurian mixed with Emilian and Tuscan – a collection of sonnets, in which he put the history of the village into verse, Bulan ent’la storia (1970).
It cannot be said that the undertaking was a perfect success, since Grossi most often limits himself to transcribing hearsay and fables, handed down, or resulting from documents, and very rarely are these verses touched by the wing of poetry.
The work is however of some interest, if only for the effort and labor which were necessary to realize it.
Bruno Micossi (1919–1989)
Micossi was born in Pontebba (Udine) and was brought to Genoa as a child. Interestingly, as an outsider, he mastered the use of Genoese, which he used to write metrically exact sonnets, and from this expressive formula – which became a characteristic of his – he never strayed.
Thus wrote Toso: “a Gismondi-like lyricism, where natural descriptions and good feelings prevail, leaving little room for any further development”.
Often Micossi touched on topics, which today would be fashionable and would be called “animal welfare”, environmentalism and also inspired by the news.
He published Muggetti de parolle (1985).
This sonnet probably inspired by one of the photographs of refugees, fleeing the Vietnam War or Cambodia, when they reached newspapers in the West.
Commendable, as indeed in all of Micossi’s sonnets, are the rhetorical prowess and the climax of the performance, which reach the conclusion deftly, unfolding a series of persuasive images.
Ettore Morteo (1874–?)
With his Rimme Arascine, Ettore Morteo gave rise in 1927 to a local tradition that continues to this day.
In the most engaged part of the collection “melancholy tones prevail, expressed through an elegant environmental adaptation of themes beloved by late Romantic and decadent poetry”.[1].
[1] F. Toso, Letteratura genovese e ligure in genovese e nei dialetti locali, Le Mani, 2009.
Luigi Panero (1903–1960)
Panero was a floriculturist from Loano, who was murdered for obscure reasons, and the killer (or killers) was never found.
His poetic production is likened by many to that of Firpo, for the vivid feeling of nature that offers cues to meditations of an intimate and existential nature, which is barely hinted at.
Giuseppe Peragallo (1812–1849)
Peragallo was known for his Canzoni Sacre Popolari in Italian, which had a wide circulation and in 1870 had already reached twenty-four editions. In Genoese his streak was rather sporadic, according to what the editors wrote in the preface to the 1870 edition of his poems: “most of them written, or rather improvised in the public Academies in the Archbishop’s Seminary, they breathe brio, grace, naturalness, not separated from that chastity typical of his beautiful soul”.
One of his best-known Genoese poems was invariably declaimed at Christmas time by children standing on a chair in front of the Nativity scene in churches: “Cao Bambinetto dexiderou / ah, scialla scialla che t’ò trovou…” and is mistakenly included as the work of an anonymous Savona poet in O Cicciollâ.
An Anthology of Savona Poetry (Lodola, Savona, 1930).
Of liberal, republican, and anti-Austrian sentiments, Peragallo in this text gives us “a characteristic example of civil poetry, linked to Risorgimento themes, interesting above all as a phenomenon of taste and as evidence of the popularizing function, entrusted to Genoese expression in the pre-unification period”[1].
[1] F. Toso, La letteratura ligure in genovese e nei dialetti locali, Le Mani, Recco, 2009.
Luigi Persoglio (1830–1911)
He was a combative Jesuit, journalist and polemicist, author of politically and morally enganged comedies.
He exalted the popular and rural Ligurian world, in whose values, mentality and language he identified a bulwark against the corruption of the times.
His comedies, mostly published in “La settimana religiosa”, a Catholic peridodical and performed through the network of parish theaters, include I pastoî a-o presepio and Un pentemin à Zena.
In his satirical drama Un paise socialiste (1902) an agitator named Marx provokes a coup and establishes a government based on the principles of communism.
When the experiment fails, Marx takes flight with the state coffers.
Santino Bruno Pezzuolo (1920)
In many poetry collections and literary competitions Pezzuolo has expressed in the Alassio idiom his moral reflections – writes F. Toso[1] – “supported most often by the description of environments and situations, which are revealed in the final verses as metaphors of the author’s thought”.
His works include I strassui de Pessö (1961) and U berrettin cu-a balla (1985).
[1] F. Toso, Letteratura genovese e ligure in genovese e nei dialetti locali, Le Mani, 2009.
Although Pezzuolo’s poems follow a conversation and popular style, we can be observe in them the author’s intent to ennoble his language by means of forms and constructs from literary Italian, such as the repeated verb/object inversions, implemented for metrical reasons, or to give more emphasis to the object itself, as in the following poem: “bunasse cippe a rumpe” instead of “a rumpe bunasse cippe”.
Luigi Poggi
Poggi was a nurse at the San Martino Hospital and a poet. As F. Toso wrote[1], he was “animated by a lively sense of nature, which mostly resolves itself in outcomes borrowed from the work of his friend and teacher Alfredo Gismondi”.
Poggi’s verses are simple and song-like, partly as a result of the poet’s work as a songwriter.
He published Da l’alba a-o tramonto (Zena, 1949) and Lezi… passa… taxi.

Gianni Priano (1962)
Gianni Priano was born in 1962 in Genoa, where he lives.
A graduate in philosophy and a teacher by trade, he has written and published poems, essays, and short stories in Italian, starting with L’ombra di un imbarco (1991) up to Luce che passi sotto (2022). He has collaborated with many literary magazines, including Il Babau, Resine, Atelier, Fotocopianda, Versodove.
He is editor of “Il foglio”, a quarterly of the “Adriano Guerrini” Tiglieto (Genoa) Library.
Although Ligurian and Piedmontese inserts were to be found in his writings even earlier, more recently he has begun to write in Genoese with some continuity.
Without wishing to be wholly realistic, Priano’s frequently narrative inspiration is mixed with the reality of everyday life and succeeds in representing it more than many who intentionally put themselves into it; perhaps because the author is also too much of a philosopher not to know that reality does not exist in itself, but possesses the meaning and texture we give it.
We often find in these verses echoes of Caproni, with his conflicted adherence to Christianity, but also meditations on being and time and on a world steeped in blood, excrement and semen, which seem to recall Heidegger (“make me throw myself / into the world”) and Bataille. At times, strangely enough, there are also similarities with Guareschi, with his communists who do not believe in God, but have faith in the Madonna, with his love of peasant life and the bond with the land, which for Priano takes on feminine values, and finally is like the mother’s womb to which one would like to return.

Author’s remark.
Not to clarify but to complicate matters further, note that “the night when all cows are black” is an expression of Hegel who, polemicizing with Schelling, posits the absolute as a dimension that preserves differences and does not nullify them within an unreal dimension.
In the Hegelian absolute it is daytime and the spotted cow remains spotted, the white cow remains white and the black cow (only the black cow) remains black.

Giuliano Rossi (16th cent.–1657)
Giuliano Rossi, who was born in Sestri Ponente in the second half of the 16th century and died of the plague in 1657, practised a completely different kind of poetry from that of his contemporary Cavalli; while Cavalli was a subtle and sophisticated man of letters in his search for elaborate concepts expressed in a lofty style, Rossi wanted to appear as an easy and popular poet; he was the exponent of a poetic current that we nowadays call “dialectal” and that in the Genoese dialect would only become the dominant one towards the end of the 19th century.
Most of Rossi’s poetry, made up of occasional verses, parodies, caricatures, and even love verses, which frequently lapse into the comic, is unpublished, scattered in a large number of manuscripts, often contradicting each other.
Famous as an entertainer, a regular guest in the aristocratic houses of Genoa at the time, he had made a profession out of this activity, but an overly luxurious life caused him to fall into misery, to the point of prison for debt.
In fact, a whole part of his production is dedicated to meditation on human misery, as in his Rime Morali, where he recounts his experience in the prisons of the Republic.
But even in the most serious moments, Rossi never renounces comic banter, so much so that his best known poem is perhaps his description of the plague of 1657, the one where he lost his life, but here his barbs take on a danse macabre cadence, they are the bitter, perhaps even unintentional, commentary on the end of a world of presumptuous puppets, large and small, who disappear forever: “There are those who all day long looking for trouble / took every fly out of their noses / and now they can’t – buried in the open – / take off the millions that are in their buttocks”.
In this poem, Giuliano Rossi recounts the terrible plague of 1657, in which he himself was to lose his life.
The distraught visionary imagery, the conceptualist wordplay, again serve the poet’s harsh moralism; the Genoese are punished for their sins and can only hope in divine mercy.
In such anguish, that “endless noise of people”, which resounds again and again in the city shattered by the epidemic and human wickedness, survives forever in the reader’s memory.
[1] Bubboin: even today we say bugna to mean a job badly done.
[2] carbuoin: reddish tumours that foreshadowed an even more ominous prognosis.
One mustn’t forget that most of Rossi’s poetry is comic poetry and poetry of occasion; anticipating Piaggio and Signor Regina’s scampagnate by centuries, Rossi recounts the adventures of his trip to Venice with a group of bewildered friends.
One of his most famous texts.

Luigi Stallo (19th cent.)
Stallo was from Sampierdarena, a neighborhood that dedicated an alley to him.
He was a follower of Mazzini and Garibaldi, and a member of the Humanitarian Philanthropic Society, within which, in 1854, he was among the promoters of the food sector in favor of workers, based on the purchase of raw materials (potatoes, wheat and flours, rice, oil, wine, legumes, etc., and also coal), through capital raised among the members, with bonds of 50 lire each.
It was the first step towards the more organized consumer cooperatives, which would develop considerably ten years later.
Stallo was in favor of a people’s democracy based on universal voting, rights of the poorest, education and culture, and social progress for workers.
Accused of sedition for an attempted insurrection at the time of Carlo Pisacane’s departure, and captured by police on June 29, 1859, he managed to escape, but was tried in his absence (with Mazzini and Antonio Mosto) and sentenced to ten years in prison.
He was among the Genoese Carabinieri and participated in person and as a volunteer in Garibaldi’s wars.
In 1868 he is the founder and first president of the societies “Società M.S. dei Volontari Italiani di San Pier d’Arena” and “Ass.ne Reduci delle patrie battaglie”.
He was not elected the following year, because on July 7, 1869 he was imprisoned in the citadel of Alexandria, and in 1870 in Gaeta.
After leaving prison, he strongly criticized Garibaldi after the French expedition, publishing a volume in Chambery, France, in 1871, titled Truth and Slander in the Face of General Giuseppe Garibaldi.
Memories of an Italian Volunteer in France and as a result of this he was removed from the associations and ostracized.
Of Stallo we also know of a poem in Italian titled L’orfanella di un volontario italiano morto a Mentana il 3 novembre 1867 (Genoa, Tipografica Economica, 1877).
This Vixon, which follows in the nineteenth-century fashion of calendars, also contains, after the poetic text, a small calendar for 1853 and even, added by hand, the rates of coaches between different places in the Kingdom of Sardinia.
The language used by Stallo, with all its concessions to the Italian, to the Genoese of the bourgeoisie, makes one think of Pedevilla, but here the criticism of the Catholic Church and the rulers is very harsh and makes one fully understand the Mazzinian and Masonic roots of its author, with his faith in a deity who takes to heart the cause of Italian patriots, and fights on the same side of the people, as in the stanzas of the Italian anthem, l’Inno di Mameli.
Because of its elaborate writing, scholarly references (among its models even Dante, or the Petrarch of The Triumphs), and formal care, the poem was certainly not intended for the people, but served to attract to Mazzini’s cause that enlightened and educated middle class who were in a position to appreciate it and share its ideals.
The emigrant of the title is, of course, a republican exile who, with the rather abused expedient of the vision, in the space of eighty-one metrically perfect sestines, reviews the past and prophesies future events, even to the point of imagining the United States of Europe, and even those of the World, ruled as a democratic republic. Another demonstration of how, in those days, the Genoese language could be useful in dealing with lofty subjects and in spreading propaganda of all kinds, because of its ability to reach everyone easily.
The patriot sees the souls of all the martyrs of freedom of thought, starting with the usual Giordano Bruno and Galileo, but he also adds Dante, as he is considered an opponent of the Church and the Papacy, and in addition Savonarola, Cola da Rienzo, Masaniello, and others, all considered martyrs of future freedom, and then, as is logical, all the Carbonari involved in the various insurrections who were shot.
This vision is followed by another, that of ancient and modern tyrants, who plot to eliminate liberalism, and are commanded by churchmen, such as Father Gusman the inquisitor, who is in favor of harsh repression, while Father Rhotaan speaks in favor of reforms to better deceive the liberals, spreading discord and divisions in the opposing camp.
Vanishing even this vision, the patriot sees advancing armed men of companies, representing the peoples of the land, each with a flag marked with a symbolic sign.
In front of the flag prophesying the United States of Europe, “all passion for their native land” disappears in everyone and is replaced by universal love for humanity.
And here one wonders why one would need to be a patriot, if it is already fated that patriotism will dissolve into a more generic and faded love for the United States of Europe, or towards some more distant still United States of the World.
The two characters named towards the end, Louis and Joseph, who raise so many hopes of millenarian renewal in the author, seem to be Garibaldi and Louis Napoleon, who will shortly thereafter become emperor of the French, following an undemocratic process, betraying the expectations of patriots on both sides of the Alps. But it is known that not all “visions” get it right.
Augusto Tessada (20th cent.)
Not much is known about Augusto Tessada, apart from the fact that, as he dixe himself, he was an employee of City Hall.
Often, his verses are of occasion, and his interest is drawn mainly by facts of news and custom, by current events. In this sense, his Cappon Magro of 1909 is indicative of a way of thinking, of an era at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which saw the disappearance of so many customs and mentalities, the interest in but also the disquiet about modern science and the times to come, the reproach of the excesses of fashion, the appearance of the first automobiles.
The abstract moralism of the good bourgeois was to give way within a few years to the unconditional exaltation of the age of technology and the machine, when the economic advantages that would follow were clear.
Note how, in his indictment against the automobile, Tessada sees its use only for the purpose of escapism, to get high on speed, almost as a modern take on the classic “carpe diem”, and a celebration of the nullity of life. The arguments he uses are the same as those he might use against alcohol or drug addiction.
Tessada’s caricature of the sportsman brings to mind certain characters of his era, which we still see in old silent films – the strongman with a stiff mustache – and a certain foreshadowing of the “much sought after” Gastone by Petrolini, evidently a topical feature.
Silvio Volta (1891–1957)
Volta, a singular figure who was an engineer and a politician, published in 1933 A commedia çellasca, a parody of Dante’s Inferno, which takes aim at various characters in the Celle of his time. Beyond the rather conventional gimmicks that characterize the work, there is no shortage of fresh lyrical insights.
Other poems by Volta have been lost, but we remember a well-executed version of Goethe’s Erlkönig.
Under the guise of describing the circle of lustful inhabitants of Celle, the author goes back in his memory to the years when he and other young men, in the summertime at the beach tried to impress female tourists and indulges in nostalgia, in a semi-humorous tone.
“Miödiña” is the Ligurian name for Herodias, a strongly negative figure from the Gospels, who among us has become synonymous with a false, hypocritical person. Volta uses this name to translate the word, which is difficult to interpret, Erlkönig, the title of a famous ballad by Goethe, usually translated into Italian as The King of the Fairies.
Pantaleo Grimaldi Murassana (1554 – 17th cent.)
Grimaldi Murassana was born in Genoa in 1554 from a Savona family, and moved to Savona as a boy, where he was an innkeeper by trade and a poet by passion. He was a friend of Chiabrera’s, in contact with various representatives of the Riviera aristocracy.
He delighted in attitudes and manners that nowadays we would call bohemian and maudit, as a tavern poet, and often his poetry seems to take on the manner and setting of a play.
The Spinner of this song was a Neapolitan courtesan. Grimaldi Murassana sings her praises in a rather subdued tone, except for then – as was his custom – indulging in vulgar language, which was undoubtedly more palatable to his tavern audience.
Anton Giulio Brignole Sale (1605–1665)
Anton Giulio Brignole Sale belonged to one of the most powerful families of the Republic. Born in 1605 and died in 1665, he was a thinker, poet, playwright and politician, an advocate of greater autonomy of the Republic in relation Spain.
In the second part of his life, from 1649, he renounced all political appointments and took priestly orders, eventually becoming a Jesuit in 1652.
He authored multilingual comedies, The Two Similar Rings and The Comic Slaves, according to the custom of the time, and he transfused his satirical and polemical vein into them.
In a work such as Li comici schiavi we can come across the Genoese character of Corporal Berodo, the bumbling soldier who produces incredible boastfulness, destined to be punctually mocked, forerunner of other Ligurian masks, such as Barudda and Monòdda, quarrelsome and confused commoners.
Comic theatre in the 17th century was often multilingual and usually each character was a mask, characterised by a different dialect.
The most popular character with the Genoese public was the Caporale (corporal), the fanatical soldier, who always ended up making a bad impression.
However, when comedies were performed outside Genoa, the part of the corporal or the other Genoese masks was translated into Italian or even suppressed. This was due both to the local political allusions with which the corporal’s tirades were stuffed, and also to the puns and double entendres, which the Genoese liked at the time, but which were incomprehensible outside Genoa.
This also explains the lack of popularity of Genoese theatre and its masks in the rest of Italy, which are still overlooked to this day.
The other two characteristic Genoese masks, which always returned in 17th-century theatre and which have survived, with variations, almost to the present day in masked carnival parades, were the lustful, miserly old man with the mischievous young servant girl who always rejects him.
Brignole Sale takes up the two characters in his comedy I due anelli simili and makes them express themselves with all the vivacity and liveliness that the situation calls for.
In this scene, old Pasquale asks his goddaughter Bianchinetta to marry him, to avoid paying the dowry to a possible suitor.
Brignole Sale also seems to have written a few humorous poems, of which this one, full of double entendres and erotic or learned allusions like the corporal’s tirades at the theatre, and dedicated to one of his overly exorbitant mistresses, is an example.
[1] In Latin grammar, the genitive case precedes the dative.
The author therefore means that with this woman one must be ready to give (dare) before using the “genitals”.
[2] “Loro” is the typical name for parrots; in this case, it recalls the echoes the name of gold (“l’oro”).
[3] “Donato” is a classic Latin grammar.
This woman would sooner pick up the “Donato” than the “Orlando Furioso”… [4] “if you don’t move your hands (to get money out), you may as well move your feet (to leave)”. [5] the word “pagai” (porgies) suggests the act of “paying”; “orate” (seabreams) suggests the word “gold”.
[6] Marfisa is a warrior woman from the French chivalry poems. In this case, the spear has to be made of gold in order to send her fleeing.
[7] “I don’t know whether one accumulates more by summing (being together), or by dividing.”
Pier Giovanni Capriata (16th–17th cent.)
Peo Zane Craviâ was a doctor of law and a historiographer. In 1628 he took part in the conspiracy hatched by Giulio Cesare Vachero against the Republic and was then exiled to Spain.
He returned to Genoa in 1633.
His burlesque intermezzo, Ra finta caritè, is the first complete example of a play written entirely in Genoese and owes much to contemporary Spanish picaresque literature.
In it, the young Tognin, apprentice to the blind beggar Batté, takes harsh revenge for the abuse and beatings he has had to endure from his master.
Capriata’s scenic intermezzo presents us with a merciless world of thugs and vagabonds, who have to scramble constantly to scrape together a few pennies. The blind Batté chases away his helper Tognin, who is blind in one eye, but can see enough to rob him; the latter takes revenge by picking a fight with his new partner Pellegro, taking advantage of the joke played on them by the nobleman Leandro, when he pretends to give charity to the two blind men, but gives them nothing.
Batté and Pellegro accuse each other of stealing, beat each other up, and are left half dead.
It is not known whether the play was ever staged, but it certainly contrasts sharply with the image of a city that has been handed down to us of a very compassionate city, willing to help the destitute.
Giovanni Agostino Pollinari (17th cent.)
Il Genio Ligure Trionfante (1697) by Giovanni Agostino Pollinari, is a drama inspired by the historic and long resistance of the Ligurians to the Roman invasion, but in fact alluding to the contention between Genoa and France, which had led to the terrible bombardment of 1684 by the Sun King’s fleet.
Here, Caporale, while retaining many morally questionable character traits, takes on an ultimately positive connotation and engages in genuine battles for the first time, risking his life.
Remarkable is the fact that the name of the Corporal is, on this occasion, Balilla. One cannot escape the suggestion that there is some connection with the hero of Portoria. In fact, it should not be forgotten that in the earliest records about the anti-Austrian uprising of 1746, the boy who threw the stone is not mentioned, let alone named.
So, the suspicion about the infiltration of some scholarly or even collectively popular reminiscence in the choice of the name given to the hero seems more than well-founded.
Carlo Andrea Castagnola (1652–1748)
Castagnola was a Jesuit from Lavagna, also known as a historian and author of a piece on the comet of 1664. In his poem L’arrivo in Vuoè dell’Armà de Franza he recalls the bombardment of Genoa by the French fleet in 1684.
A question of precedence in the greeting between ships of the two nations had offered the Sun King the right to humiliate the small and proud Genoese republic, with which disagreements and disputes had long arisen.
Genoa did not yield, Spanish ships came to its rescue, and the French had to leave.
However, the following year, in a changed political situation, Doge Lercari had to go to Versailles to pay his respects to the King and apologise to him.
Received with all honours, amidst the splendour of the palace, he was asked what, in that opulent palace, had most amazed him.
He replied with an expression that later became almost a proverb: “Mi chì” (“my presence here”).
The Doges, in fact, never set foot outside the palace during their entire tenure, and even to go to Mass on Sundays they passed through an elevated corridor that led to S. Lorenzo, so as not to touch the ground with their feet, thus emphasising the sacredness of their person.
The poem narrates the events of 1684, along with the love affair of Dr Orlando, a witness to the events and personal physician to the Doge’s wife.
Stefano Rossi (17th cent.)
Stefano Rossi, one of the first poets to have written in one of the intemeli dialects, is remembered for his 1639 poem in Taggiasco L’antico valore degli huomini di Taggia, where he recounts how a barbarian attack was repulsed by the inhabitants of the village in the year 1554.
The entire narrative takes place in the comic register, in imitation of La Secchia Rapita by Tassoni.
In other poems, Rossi advocates the use of local Ligurian as opposed to both Genoese and Italian, both of which are considered too courtly and lofty a language to be spontaneous and straightforward, like the native languages.
Rossi’s work thus testifies to the high opinion that was widespread about Genoese literature on the Riviera at the time.
Paolo Agostino Orengo (17th cent.)
The earliest known writer in intemelio Ligurian is one Gerolamo Lanteri, who, around 1600, wrote a collection of sonnets and epigrams in Ventimigliese, unfortunately lost, as is the Musa Ventimigliese by Paolo Agostino Orengo, c. 1650. Of Orengo, however, we are left with three sonnets, recorded by Father Angelico Aprosio in La Grillaia, where he discusses the languages of Italy (but the Ventimigliese sonnets were suppressed from the printed edition).
Orengo had sent the sonnets from Rome to Lucerne to his fellow citizen Domenico Antonio Cotta Sismondi, Apostolic Nuncio to the Catholic Cantons in Switzerland.
Because of the references to local people and events of the time, the sonnets are difficult to understand, but they were also incomprehensible to Aprosio, who compares them to Burchiello’s poems.
However, Orengo’s texts have testimonial value; note that the spelling is the same as the Genoese of those times, with the “o” pronounced “u” and all the other well-known peculiarities, but with the addition of “y” to indicate the semivocalic “i”.
Stefano De Franchi (1714–1785)
Steva De Franchi, a Genoese patrician born into a family that had given several doges to the Republic, is always remembered for his popular poems that precede Piaggio, who lived in the following century, and also for his songs on patriotic subjects, inspired by the 1746 uprising against the Austro-Piedmontese.
One can sense in the poet the desire of a part of the nobility to attract the popular classes, and above all the bourgeoisie, gathering them around an ideal and renewing, all together, the Genoese state of the time, sclerotized and fallen to the sole defence of the interests of the aristocracy.
We can easily consider De Franchi an Enlightenment man, who like all his peers would like to lead the people to gradual improvements in the social condition, under the guidance of the principles of reason.
But nowadays, what strikes us most in his work are not so much the hymns to Genoa’s freedom, nor the descriptions of popular situations and characters, such as the famous “Mrs Cinciallegra on the square of Ponticello”, but rather his melancholic vein, charged with the weariness of an entire world that was now declining.
Already in his evocations of the pastimes of the nobility, amid gardens, villas, boating and easy love affairs, one senses a depth of sadness: “he who has time and loses time / does not recover it any more / the green of youth / withers and falls”.
But this state of mind appears even more clearly in the sonnet on the Lisbon earthquake of 1755: “The kingdoms die and the cities die / greatness ends in dust and debris”; and in others, such as Meditation on Death and In te Domine confido: “I live in this world, and like who? / Like one who does not believe he will ever die / and meanwhile that day draws near / and time sets sail and goes away”.
De Franchi wanted to be the poet of the “Genoese nation” and numerous, in his verses, are the citations and references to the authors that preceded him, from the Anonym to Cavalli; the Lezzendia that follows may remind us of, for instance, the medieval poet’s verses on the battles of Laiazzo and Korčula.
De Franchi is also to be remembered as a playwright: his translations from Molière, Regnard and Palaprat are more like imitations and adaptations, from which the playwright took plots and characters and made something new out of them that could serve to represent the Genoese reality.
It must be said that the Genoese poet does not even try to come close to the “tragic” Moliére of Tartuffe, Le Misanthrope, or Dom Juan, which we might like better, but which is also too closely linked to the religious, political and philosophical quarrels of his time; Instead, De Franchi works on timeless plots, of mere amusement, which are appreciated for the comic play of situations and at the same time revives characters that were already part of Genoese theatre at the time, such as the fanatical corporal, the mischievous servant girl, the old man in love and miserly man who makes a fool of himself.
In the following tirade, which is taken from O maiezzo pe fòrsa (Le mariage forcé) and which is not found in Moliére’s original text, the soldier Ormondo, a new incarnation of the Genoese mask of the corporal, seems almost a relative of the Baron of Munchhausen, due to the strangeness of his boasting.
Ra Gerusalemme deliverà (18th cent.)
In 1755, the two-volume Ra Gerusalemme deliverà dro Signor Torquato Tasso traduta in lengua zeneize was published in Genoa. It was a Genoese version of Tasso’s masterpiece Jerusalem Delivered, by a team of urban scholars, directed by the poet Stefano De Franchi.
It was a curious and unusual work, since the authors did not intend to perform a faithful translation of the Jerusalem – as Father Federico Gazzo would translate the Divine Comedy in its entirety in the following century – but neither was it a parody, a burlesque disguise, as had already been done in various other Italian languages.
Instead, the 18th-century scholars wanted to substantially respect the intentions and narrative structure of Tasso’s work, but at the same time re-create it from a “Genoese” point of view; the entire chivalric poem is thus rewritten as a Genoese person of the time might have told it.
Nor did the translators lack the intention to emulate and surpass the translations that had already appeared in other Italian idioms up to that time, as can be seen from a prefatory sonnet, which states:
As if to say that if the other translations – into Bolognese (ro Dottô), Venetian (Pantalon), Bergamasque (Xanni), and Neapolitan (Coviello) – changed Tasso into a buffoon and were successful, the Genoese mask of Caporale could not lag behind, capable as he is of witty remarks.
In spite of this premise, the comedic intonation only surfaces from time to time, in this Genoese version of Jerusalem Delivered, generally remaining far above other similar attempts, which were typical of a reflexive and generally uninteresting dialectalism. In fact, it can be said that the whole operation is part of the complex work undertaken by De Franchi to enrich the literature of Genoese expression with valid and up-to-date works, with a view to exalting the Genoese homeland.
At a time of substantial political decadence for the Republic of Genoa, as was the 18th century, some intellectuals felt the need to recompose the social classes around the nobility, reviving patriotic sentiment. For this purpose, literature in Genoese seemed a particularly suitable tool, due to the identitarian use that had been made of it over the centuries.
De Franchi thus wanted to be the poet of the “Naçion Zeneise” (Genoese Nation), advocating, among other things, moderate corrections to a now sclerotic secular, social and political order, to which he addresses moderate criticism in his comedies.
De Franchi’s was certainly a strongly paternalistic conception of the state, but the supposedly popular style in which he expressed it did not fail to influence numerous authors, most of them anonymous and Jacobin-inspired, who would appear at the end of the century.
As for the translation of the Jerusalem, the political motive is to be found, in particular, in the exaltation of the contribution made at the time by the Genoese to the reconquest of the Holy Land, on which a whole series of legends and traditions had already flourished, linked to the figure of Guglielmo Embriaco, “the Ligurian doge, who once upon a time / crossed the seas as their master”.
Seven different poets – Stefano De Franchi, Ambrogio Conti, Gaetano Gallino, Paolo Toso, Giacomo Guidi, Gian Agostino Gastaldi and Francesco Maria Viceti – gave their version of the twenty cantos of Jerusalem Delivered, strictly respecting the same number of octaves as in the original, sometimes keeping very close to the text, sometimes lowering the tone to remain faithful to a Ligurian spirit that is all concreteness and practicality, and sometimes again creating completely new pieces of poetry.
Consider the octaves – in Ambrogio Conti’s version – in which the figure of Columbus is commemorated (15, 31–32):
In Canto 7, translated by Stefano De Franchi, the similarity of the eels caught in the Comacchio valleys is portrayed closer to the experience of the Genoese, in a coastal setting, with reference to the tuna fishery of Portofino.
In Canto 12 (octaves 62–69) we have the death of Clorinda, in Paolo Toso’s version.
The drama of the situation is properly portrayed, with depth of feeling:
Gaetano Gallino (18th cent.)
Stefano De Franchi had encouraged his friend Gaetano Gallino, a painter of whose life not much is known, to represent the events of the popular uprising of 10 December 1746 against the Austro-Piedmontese in a series of paintings.
Gallino preferred to respond to his friend’s request with a series of nineteen sonnets, not at all aimed at extolling heroism and war – except for a few passages – but rather filled with a pensive happiness and almost a sense of the vanity of all things.
A cannon shot grazes general Botta Adorno,[1] who almost dies, but the general then manages to escape across the mountains.
Gallino wishes him to go all the way to the end of the world, where – according to legend – the stone from which all winds and storms of the world arise.
[1] General Botta Adorno led the Austrian army and was of Ligurian origin. There was an old grudge between him and the Genoese aristocracy, as his ancestors had been exiled.
On the whole, the poet is not so much caught up in the exaltation of battle, but rather shows a tendency to reason, to reflect on Genoa’s past glories that, as they have come, may one day be forgotten, or fade into history.
Toralbo Armonico (18th cent.)
In the second half of the 18th century, following the Defranchian example that pushed for a national literature exalting Genoese valour and values, a whole series of texts appeared, tickling popular pride by singing of naval victories achieved against Tunisian and Algerian pirates. The names of the authors, often Arcadian pseudonyms – Micrilbo Fenizio, Fabrizio Giano, Toralbo Armonico – already make it clear that this is not popular literature, but the work of scholars, who want to refer to the mentality of the people and on the other hand refer to the great tradition of the thirteenth-century Anònimo. They entrust their production to pamphlets and flyers that can have the widest circulation. Thus begins, or rather intensifies, the phenomenon of the vernacularisation of Genoese literature, which will come to fruition the following century.
Thus, this Toralbo Armonico, of whom we know nothing, except that he was eighty years old when he wrote his poem, tells us of the victory against “a strong Tunisian xebec on the waters of Talamone”, reported by Captain Gian Antonio Maglione, from Laigueglia, in the year 1781.
Antonio Durazzo (18th cent.)
In this dialogue, perhaps not intended to be staged and attributed to Antonio Durazzo, two brothers, the patricians Alerame and Bernardo Pallavicini, accused of various offenses after the fall of the oligarchic Republic, find themselves in the hall of the Minor Council, transformed into a prison for the aristocrats.
Bernardo has not abandoned the overbearing ways of when he was in government and demands to be obeyed as he once was, while Alerame, former doge of the Republic, presented as a succubus of Bernardo, fails to make him understand that times have changed.
Luigi Michele Pedevilla (1815–1877)
Pedevilla was a priest with liberal leanings, close to Gioberti’s ideas. He was very far from the positions of the Church of the time in terms of politics, and would have wanted a federalist and democratic regime for Italy that resembled the Swiss one, in which Genoa and Liguria could have enjoyed complete autonomy.
Between 1842 and 1870, with pauses and interruptions, Pedevilla published O Lunäio do Sciô Tocca, in which, following the example of Martino Piaggio, he commented on events in the city in a satirical tone, but with a “progressive” political passion that Piaggio would not have allowed himself.
In the early days of the Lunäio, Tocca shared the enthusiasm of other liberals for the figure of Pius IX, but as the Pontiff approached reactionary positions, the hopes that the Church could be of help to the Risorgimento cause diminished.
It is worth to remember, in the Lunäio of 1850, the poem E bomboe, where Pedevilla denounces the violence and bombardments carried out in April 1849 by the Piedmontese army against the city, when Genoa – after the disaster of Novara and also due to the fear of an Austrian invasion – had deluded itself that it could once again be a republic and had risen up.
Pedevilla’s fundamental and most ambitious work, however, remains A Colombiade (1870), a re-enactment of Columbus’ enterprise, which in the author’s intention should have been the national poem of Liguria, as Verdaguer’s Atlantida is for Catalonia. Due to both the lack of linguistic care and the conventionality of the story, the poem was unsuccessful except for a few rather inspired descriptions and a few minor episodes that serve as pretexts for the polemics dear to the author. Above all, what stands out are the attacks against the Savoy monarchy and its ministers, especially Cavour “a minister who is a matchmaker and a speculator / who sells like a commodity / a city of Italy to an emperor” (regarding the cession of Nice to Napoleon III’s France) and the false freedom of the Statute they boast of.
Agostino Bruno (1842-1910)
Agostino Bruno, born in Quiliano in 1842, was Secretary of the Savona Municipality, and studied its history, customs, and historical figures, and was himself a leading figure in the cultural life of the western city in the second half of the 19th century.
He composed various works of local interest, including a Storia di Savona (1901).
His poems were published in the Lunäio de Savoña and in the strenna O regallo pe-o 1865 and one can feel the ever-present influence of Chiabrera, whose work he popularized.
He died in Savona in 1910.
In this invocation to the morning star, although addressed to the Blessed Virgin, there is perhaps an almost pagan inspiration for the beauty and complexity of the universe.
Carlo Malinverni (1855-1922)
Carlo Malinverni was employed all his life as a clerk at the Cassa di Risparmio, and combined this occupation with an attitude as a maudit poet. He was a fervent Republican and Mazzinian in his youth, and later looked at these ideals with greater detachment in his adulthood.
He began his poetic activity with a few collections of poems in Italian with political and social overtones, later devoting himself to the Genoese language, transposing into it the themes of the Second Romantics and Scapigliati, which were in vogue at the time.
In Malinverni’s poetry, attention to small things, to traditional Genoese customs, to the world of childhood, and to the spectacles of nature relived with participation and sensitivity, is combined with compassion for the sufferings of the humble and the outcast, expressed in a musicality that seems to come from a kind of veristic melodrama, as well as with a late Risorgimento rhetoric that becomes unbearable at times, especially in the propaganda poems written during World War I. Considered by many a leading figure, as the one who at the turn of the century had restored Genoese poetry to its serious possibilities, anticipating Firpo, he adapted more than anything else certain nineteenth-century themes to the Genoa of his time, somewhat like Vigo.
According to P. Guidoni, “Malinverni’s compositions reveal traits of an intimism tinged with melancholy in which one can hear echoes of contemporary experiences in the language, without interfering much with an inspiration that is mainly indebted to local atmospheres.
However, with this modest but clear-visioned author, poetry in Genoese once again becomes characterized as an autonomous cultural fact, due to the regained consciousness of possessing its own expressive tool”.[1].
Indeed, Malinverni operates a moderate purification of language, which, as mentioned above, especially with Bacigalupo and his imitators, had become saturated with Italianisms.
[1] P. Guidoni, Saggi sulla poesia genovese, A Compagna, Genova, 1997.
The prevalent singability of the verse, the choice of vaguely lachrymose sentimental themes, place Malinverni close to the taste for the “in grigio et in silenzio” harmonies that were in vogue with the audiences of his time and to the dim, bourgeois situations typical of veristic melodrama – as in this case, where the setting, the psychological climate and even the name of the protagonist seem to be taken from Puccini’s repertoire, although the story is transposed to a Genoese setting.
[2] Staggen: Staglieno, location of the Monumental Cemetery.
[3] terrapin: on the hill behind Genoa, common destination for spring outings.
The frequent use of onomatopoeia, the participatory observation of nature elected as a symbol of the poet’s moods, place Malinverni in the wake of the imitators of Pascoli, one of his clear models.
[4] o tempo o l’é in candeia: literally “the weather is in candle”, i.e. it has settled beautifully.
[5] Baciccia di Cöi, Giambattista dei Cavoli, the name of a city minstrel who has become a symbol for the quintessential Genoese commoner.
An ill-concealed sensuality runs beneath Malinverni’s verses, making itself explicit only from time to time, as in this sonnet, so daring for its time that one of its earliest readers, G. Macaggi, had to dissimulate embarrassment, commenting on the subject that “art redeems daring”[6].
[6] G. Macaggi, preface to C. Malinverni, Due brocche de viovetta, 1908.
Upon Pascoli’s death, Malinverni dedicated these verses to the memory of the man he considered his great teacher.
The local version Malinverni gives us of the Baudelairian spleen is the “gnagnoa”, a word that does not exactly translate the English “boredom”, but adds to it a sense of annoyance and almost anguish about tomorrow.
Immersed in an awareness of the vanity of his efforts, even politically and artistically, and unclouded by any religious hope for the future, the poet indulges in melancholy considerations about his own fate and that of his poetry.
[7] beuga-bugagna: children’s lullaby.
Characteristic of Malinverni is his interest in the world of childhood, often combined with the evocation of Christmas traditions. In it, the poet manages to identify with great ease and sympathy.
Giambattista Rapallo (1848–1929)
Rapallo was a highly esteemed physician and an assiduous contributor to the humorous newspaper “Il Successo”, where he signed with the pseudonym “Baciccia”. He preferred the sonnet form and his literary output is almost exclusively comical and satirical in character, but nowadays it must be acknowledged that his verses are often wittier and more apt than those of other better-known comedians, his contemporaries and successors, even in other Italian regional languages.
At least “Baciccia” struck sure and unabashedly, not to mention the quality of his Genoese, not infrequently more frank and genuine than that of many.
Some of his jokes have become so popular that they still circulate today as anonymous jokes, and on a few occasions they seem to have provided the cue for sketches by the well-known comedian Giuseppe Marzari.
His poems are largely collected in the volume Baciccia (1927).
[1] ironic and figurative: a scoundrel.
Sometimes Baciccia leaves behind his favorite stereotypical and comedic themes to touch on more serious subjects.
Enthusiastic – like all his contemporaries of the “Age of Enlightenment” and the Excelsior Ball – about the great advances made by modern science, he devotes verses to it in which he achieves an effective artistic and poetic balance.
Pietro Baccino (1940)
Pietro Baccino, born in Savona, has taught for thirty-five years in elementary school, cultivating a passion for naturalistic and botanical observation in particular and offering the expertise he acquired to his students and through magazine articles, lectures, and lessons at Unitre in Savona and Finale Ligure.
He co-authored the booklet Alberi a Savona and published the book Orchidee spontanee della provincia di Savona, the result of 20 years of research.
He has studied the language of the Ligurian hinterland, spoken in his family, of which he compiled a dictionary, and then used it, starting in 2004, to narrate in verse the work, toil, and sufferings of his father and mother and their farming world.
He also writes in Italian, walking the paths of nature, memory and affection and turning a sympathetic gaze toward the oppressed, the trampled, the forgotten.
He has published the collections Di quei giorni (winner’s prize of “Il Golfo”, 2009) and Nei binari del tempo (winner’s prize of “Voci 2010”, Mestre, IPLAC Circle).
His works are included in many anthologies, and some poems in Ligurian appeared in the literary magazine Resine, No. 124/2010.
In 2012, the collection of dialect poems U ’m parlova mé poŕe (My father spoke to me) was published, a prize to the winner of the “Gens Vibia” Competition in Marsciano.
On December 2, 2012 he was awarded in Chiavari, by the “O Castello” Association, the “Lifetime Achievement Award” for dialectal poetry.
In December 2013 he self-published a second collection in the vernacular E ciü a n’ dumand (And more I do not ask), awarded in 2016 at the “Gens Vibia” Competition.
September 2018 saw the publication of the booklet Nel mio tempo, winner of the “Il Fantasmino d’Oro” Competition.
In addition to numerous other awards, she has won first prize in 115 Literary Competitions.
Those familiar with Baccino’s photographs depicting flowers, plants, and small animals of our region know that that the same aim as these poems drives them, the same loving care and attention to aspects of nature that hasty or indifferent people are prone to overlook.
The author wrote about this poem and his choice to use Ligurian: “When my father was about to leave me, I thought of ‘collecting’ the words of his dialect, a Ligurian dialect from beyond the Savona area, with different characteristics from the Genoese of the coast.
To transcribe it, I used a phonetic spelling in order to allow as authentic a reading as possible.
After I had compiled a short dictionary, my father passed.
To remember him and tell him how much I loved him, I wrote U m’parlova mé poŕe, a short poem in his dialect, in which I imagined him telling me about his life.
I wrote more and it seemed to me that in this way I was giving voice not only to my parents, ancestors, but to a whole community, whose words before now were lost in the wind”.
Filippo Angelo Castello (20th cent.)
Little is known about Filippo Angelo Castello, who in 1930 published Zena, a Liguria e o sò folclorismo. Already from the title it is clear that the author did not want to go beyond a somewhat rhetorical celebration of local glories, beauties and characters.
He was, however, opposed to the vulgarity and double entendres that were fashionable among dialectal poets of the time, and his sonnets are all very chaste.
Occasionally there are also sustained and quite heartfelt lyrical verses to be found in his poetry, which are worthy of note, even in the evocation of facts and taverns and characters that seem very distant from us, although they date back not even a hundred years.
Luigi De Stefani (1887–1961)
Luigi De Stefani was a postal clerk, who began in the early postwar period to compose satirical poems in L’Eco della Riviera. Along with the other well-known San Remo dialectal poet Vincenzo Jacono he created the pair of commoners “Mastr’Antò u Basté” and “Bigin Sciacastrasse” who took turns writing satirical sonnets in the newspaper’s columns.
The former is a grumpy and traditionalist old man, but wise and level-headed, and the latter a washerwoman no less traditionalist, but gossipy and chatty.
On a few occasions the two characters were brought to the stage, as in the case of Buriana, performed in 1952, which also features one of De Stefani’s most famous poems, Caru mei campanin.
In this monologue, the author, setting aside for once municipal quarrels and parochial nostalgia, creates a character who lays bare the bitter truth, expressed between the grotesque and the melancholy, that the truth cannot be told.
Edoardo Firpo (1889–1957)
A great deal has been written about Edoardo Firpo, whom many consider to be the greatest 20th century poet in Genoese, in the last forty years, perhaps even too much, and his figure has ended up being mythologised.
Those unfamiliar with Genoese literature before him, have wanted to credit him with having first treated Genoese as a language; at a certain point, a veritable literary current was formed that tried to imitate his way of writing in topics, rhythms, even word choice.
Just as Firpo’s supporters, in his time, had to fight against a view of poetry in Genoese that limited it to a humorous pastime, or to regretting the past, so those of my generation found themselves fighting to make it clear that poetry in Genoese did not have to be the same as Firpo’s. Nowadays, this eagerness to make the poet of the Grillo Cantadô seem to have died down a little, and it can be admitted that Firpo was indeed a great poet; admittedly, the Genoese he used often leaves a bitter taste in the mouth: suffice it to think of lines such as the finale of a poem like Da-o tempo ciù lontan, where that “lasciando a galla appena qualche fiore” is straightforward Italian, with a bit of Genoese varnish.
Yet Firpo’s “dialectal” mentality, like that of so many others in those days, could not allow him anything else.
For Firpo, fading Genoese towards Italian meant “elevating” himself to a more spiritual language, and in most cases we could not give his verses a “more Genoese” form without ruining them.
Undoubtedly, Firpo communicates an image of Genoa that is now part of the common feeling, indeed I would say that he has changed the perception we all have of the city, especially of the Levante districts, but also of the hinterland, and nowadays we cannot think of places such as Foce, Boccadasse, Vernazzola, Carupola, without remembering Firpo’s verses and his way of making these places the scene of eternal human tragedy and the evil of living.
Colombo Gajone (1878–1973)
Colombo Gajone was a highly unique antiquarian and folk poet, already active in the 1920s, who entrusted his production to flyers and pamphlets, until the publication in 1963 of Antologia Ovadese.
A recreator of traditional genres such as the ballad and the stornello, he gives his best in evoking the landscape and natural environment of the Oltregiogo region.
Ubaldo Mazzini (1868–1923)
Born in La Spezia, he studied law but devoted himself to journalism from a young age, also due to his passion for politics.
Mazzini was called to direct the Civic Library and the Civic Museum, then devoted himself to studies and research on Ligurian antiquities and history. It was he who discovered the famous statue-stelae of Lunigiana and formulated hypotheses on their origin, which resonated with scholars not only from Italy.
A staunch republican, Mazzini in poetry is a “dialectal”, in the sense that he tries to put forward in verse the way of thinking and speaking of the commoners of La Spezia, according to what was in his day the prevailing idea of what poetry should be in the local vernaculars. Although Mazzini writes in Ligurian, his models are therefore the Romanesque Belli, or the Tuscan Fucini, or even the Neapolitan Ferdinando Russo, with his Luciano d’o Rre, texts in which the authors make characters speak in the first person, even very far from their poet’s way of thinking, in order to restore them to the readers’ judgment, in its truth and often in the grotesque enormity of his opinions and foibles; this makes one partly understand the reasons for the relative success of Mazzini’s poetry, even at the national level, and assures him a place-perhaps a minor one-in the history of Italian and even Ligurian literature.
Marino Merello (1865–1933)
Merello was a translator of Greek, Latin and French classics, the author of novels and essays of various kinds and poems also in Italian, a lover of the history of his homeland and an admirer of Genoa’s beauties and monuments. He had a crepuscular poetic vein.
Nevertheless, he often addressed political, historical, and even philosophical topics.
His works, such as Il Canzoniere a Nitouche, immediately make us think of the Genoese Belle Époque, which brought together typical personalities such as Captain D’Albertis or the eccentric poet Ceccardo, and even if Merello is not D’Annunzio, he is still interesting and characteristic of an era and mentality.
His Genoese verses are collected in the volume In tempo de guæra (1917), where, even amidst a certain amount of patriotic rhetoric, one can find numerous examples of poetry and reflection.
Worthy of interest, for example, is the collection of sonnets dedicated to E gexe de Zena (the churches of Genoa).
Elsewhere, the poet expresses an elegantly melancholic vein, full of love for nature, which, like that of his contemporary Carlo Malinverni, seems to foreshadow Edoardo Firpo.
In other cases, the poet indulges in mournful reflections.
Alessandro Monti (20th cent.)
Don Alessandro Monti put into Genoese verse – strictly Martellian – A vitta de S. Françesco d’Assisi (1900), A vitta de Fræ Françesco Maria da Camporosso (1901) and A Stòria da Madònna da Guardia (1900). His verses seem to us today rather flat, monotonous, but the purpose of the good priest was not so much to make art, but to spread the Christian message through the knowledge of the saints dear to the people and by means of the Genoese language, since Italian was not yet the heritage of everyone, as it is today, and moreover in verses it was easier to memorize.
Even the titles, colophon, dedications and captions of the illustrations of Monti’s books are written in Martellian verse, testifying to the good priest’s true passion for Genoese poetry.
In the Vita di S. Francesco Maria da Camporosso, who at that time the Church had not yet recognized as a saint, Monti collects and narrates a great number of facts, anecdotes and testimonies that later became part of the records of the canonical process for the beatification of Giovanni Croese, the secular name of Friar Francis.
Monti, too, like Persoglio, and other Genoese clergymen, never fails to make his lack of sympathy for the Italian Risorgimento felt, not only for the well-known reasons that pitted Church and State against each other at the time, but also because of the old grudge that the Genoese held against the Savoy monarchy.
Louis Notari (1879–1961)
Notari was an engineer, director of Public Works in the Principality of Monaco and later city councilor. He created the Exotic Garden, one of the most original and admired parks on the Riviera.
He founded the Committee of Monegasque Traditions and in 1927 published A legenda de Santa Devota, a Monegasque national poem.
From 1931 onwards, on his initiative, the Festin Munegascu was held, an event that arose from the collaboration of the committees of traditions of Monaco, Menton and Ventimiglia, in parallel with the publication of A barma grande, an anthology that collected each year the production of intemelio writers in the Ligurian language.
He is also the author of theatrical texts.
Other works: Bülüghe munegasche (1941), Quelques notes sur les traditions de Monaco (1960).
In the dispute between Italy and France over the possession of “unredeemed” Ligurian lands, Notari aspired to hold the balance of power.
Filippo Rostan (1896–1973)
Rostan, a native of Ventimiglia, was amongst the founders of the Intemelio magazine “A Barma Grande”, the mouthpiece of a moderate felibrism tolerated by the Fascist regime as a supporter of Italy’s irredentist claims at the time, in relation to those French territories that had once belonged to the Savoy state.
This magazine, issued in eight issues between 1931 and 1939, plus another five issues that appeared in the postwar period between 1961 and 1974, it in fact housed contributions in the Ligurian varieties of the area between Taggia and the Principality of Monaco, which display archaizing features, both lexical and syntactic.
Rostan, a poet of tenuous late crepuscular inspiration, drew on neo-Provençal models, introducing themes and tones into the modest local tradition that were, at the time, unusual and new.
Tommaso Schivo (1923–2011)
Tommso Schivo was a high school teacher of literature and philosophy, a literary critic, a poet and a connoisseur of the Alassio dialect. He was principal of the “Hanbury” language high school, he was active for a long time in the “Vecchia Alassio” association, and was also the director of studies at the Università della Terza Età.
His works include Canti e ciaiti de cà noscia (1972), where he combines his comic and folkloric output with other more engaged texts, and A pasciun e a morte du Segnù (1982), which attempts a revival of the folk religiosity of medieval laudaries.
Flora Mancini (1913–1995)
Flora Mancini was a housewife of very humble origins, who led a withdrawn and secluded existence all her life. Her only occasions for recreation were summer holidays in Ovada, where she went with her husband, the poet Carlo P. Pessino.
She was an accomplished illustrator – especially of the female face – and produced interesting pencil portraits.
Her poems are collected in A coa do pavon (Genoa, 1972), but many others have been lost.
V. E. Petrucci emphasised “the modernity of the phrasing and the inconsuetude of the themes, which at first sight seem to be of the extrapaesana brand, and immediately have vertical echoes in the emotions […] and in the images”.
Guido Nilsen (1893–1964)
Guido Nilsen was born in Genoa to a Norwegian father who was an established merchant in the dockyard. He was less shrewd than his parent in economic matters, and gradually fell into hardship financially.
His poetry favors melancholy moods, “mostly related to a painfully fatalistic consideration of life”[1], which seem to be remedied only by religious faith, or the memory of happy times.
He also wrote in Italian and French and was a well-known sportsman in the city, as a water polo player.
[1] F. Toso, La letteratura ligure in genovese e nei dialetti locali, Le Mani, Recco, 2009.
The musical nature of many of Nilsen’s lyrics, and those of some of the other authors we have mentioned so far, echoes certain Intimist and melancholic developments of the well-known Genoese songwriting “school”. Even if there are no elements that allow us to think of a direct influence of Genoese poetry on the singer-songwriters, or vice versa, one can still refer to a common mood, to a spirit of time and place, the twilight sense of an ancient city, that has impalpably and to varying degrees informed the work of all these authors, who are, moreover, so different from each other.
The love of life at sea is one of the fundamental themes of Nilsen’s poetry, which draws from it existential meditations. The theme of sailing as an escape from a reality perceived as hostile and distressing, which we have already encountered in Opisso’s verses, also returns in these poems.
[2] fascia: artificial terracing of a hill for cultivation purposes, typical of the Ligurian hinterland.
Rosita Del Buono (1906–1997)
Savona-born Rosita Del Buono, one of the few women to have dedicated herself to poetry in Ligurian, offered us straightforward lyricism, interwoven with original and delicate images, often inspired by a close dialogue with deceased loved ones.
Her visions and themes are often close to those of Firpo, with his focus on the world of nature and the suffering of all living beings.
But characteristic of Del Buono are certain figures, somewhat disturbing, or strange, glimpsed in the alleys of Savona, or moods perceived in the air of the countryside, almost carried by the breeze in the changing seasons, perhaps messages of hope or warnings that come to us from another world.
Fiorenzo Toso wrote that “Del Buono moves in a symbolic universe, peopled by survivals, memories and diaphanous presences, in an indefinite atmosphere that favours the intermediate seasons and twilight hours and where soothing certainty is represented by the affections and purifying force of poetry.”[1] For his part, Angelo Barile said: “Memories and regrets melt into a new sweetness like the tear of life when it passes into the light of memory… A distinctly feminine poetry of fresh light and human, gentle affections.
How can we not be happy that it comes to us in our mothers’ tongue?”[2].
[1] F. Toso, Letteratura genovese e ligure in genovese e nei dialetti locali, Le Mani, 2009.
[2] A. Barile, preface to Rosita Del Buono Boero – O massetto fresco, 3rd edition (Sabatelli, 1982).
Often in Del Buono’s poetry, somewhat disturbing characters appear – symbols, traces and relics of a reality different from the reassuring one of everyday life, from which they peep out almost as a warning.
The reason for their presence is not explained, but the interpretation is left to the reader.
In the case of this “woman” and this “dancing girl”, they could be allusions to the female condition, or to the more general condition of a destitute humanity, lost (or perhaps saved?) by its own illusions.
February is an unpredictable month; grumpy, tender and wild at the same time, even an old Genoese proverb associates it with the enigmatic original essence of women and the variability of the sea expanses: “Waves of the sea, February sun, women’s cries: watch out”.
Giuliano Balestreri (1910–1969)
Journalist Giuliano Balestreri brought to Genoese poetry rather different stimuli and suggestions from those to which local audiences were accustomed. But the references to jazz music, overseas settings and atmospheres blended well with a civilization and a human environment that, throughout its history, has always been affected by the most varied and diverse influences.
Far from the folklore and rhetoric about old Genoa, Balestreri sets his “timeless ballads in the dynamic city of the eastern districts, where memory, when there is any, is actualized by contrast in the daily dynamism of a commercialacapital”.[1].
Thus, the various characters and situations in Genoa’s Eastern neighborhoods are not “sketches”, but symbolic figures of the human condition.
[1] F. Toso, Emigranti do rie.
Poeti in genovese del Novecento, In forma di parole, Bologna, 1999.
Not only Balestreri’s themes, but the rhythm, the frequent breaks in the flow of verse and images, hark back to overseas atmospheres.
Even the more overtly Crepuscular and provincial themes were treated by Balestreri with a modern and stylistically innovative edge.
The choppy rhythm, the fast impressionistic notations suggest a kind of verbal jazz.
A poem like this seems to anticipate certain “mortuary” verses by Giannoni, and moreover may evoke some mysterious and seemingly suspended moments in Guidoni’s poetry.
Another theme of our twentieth-century poetry is the difficulty, but also the beauty, of transmitting the ancient values of Genoese civilization and mentality to new generations.
Compare this text with Quande l’é oa by Sergio Sileri.
[2] monte Fasce: a high hill directly behind Genoa.
Angelo De Ferrari (1921-2013)
De Ferrari was inclined to narration and description. He expressed “a civil passion deeply linked to inner instances”[1].
The author – primarily a social and civic poet like Sileri or Giannoni – senses the city’s decadence as a symptom of the loss of any authentic value in the modern world and its replacement by artificial realities. This appears to him to be directly related to the psychological and moral, as well as economic, decay of all the Genoese – and of the author in particular – who seem destined to a withdrawal into themselves, having lost the ethical reference points that once constituted their strength.
[1] F. Toso, La letteratura ligure in genovese e nei dialetti locali, Le Mani, Recco, 2009.
Ernesto Pisani (1935–?)
The poetry of Ernesto Pisani, from Varazze, like much contemporary lyrical poetry in Ligurian, is mostly directed toward an inner investigation that draws from the landscape for existential reflections. Love, family affections, regrets, the aspiration for a secluded life, and memories of past Ligurian glories make up the substance of a narrative foundation verse with good descriptive skills.
Pisani has published in Genoese: ’N’arbanella d’anciöe (1978), E öe do sô (1981), Solo mi sò… and ti (1992).
Giovanni Ghione (1952)
Ghione was born in Savona in 1952, but he lives in Varazze and worked in Genoa as a civil servant for the administration of Liguria. His interests include religious and local history.
In his poetry, Ghione gradually detaches himself from Firpo’s influence and alternates narrative tones, as in his first collection Navego incontro a-o sô (1988), with others that are bluntly lyrical. As F. Toso says, “he seems to lean toward the evocative allusiveness of the moment, in which often happy images accumulate, solarly composed in their concluded coherence”.
F. Gallea, for his part, in his introduction to Çercando a luxe (2010) points out how “the best results are found in those lyrics where the heart wins over reason and sentiment springs forth and becomes communicative, and in those where intimate and collected scenes and environments are woven”.
According to Maurizio Cucchi, however, “Ghione likes to play with verse … he follows the path of the picturesque vernacular.
All well and good, although, contrary to what one might think, getting to poetry by these means is even more difficult…”.
This last quote confirms for us that Italian critics of “vernacular” poetry always look for the “picturesque”, typical of a reductive and lesser conception, which in Ghione’s case is by far not the most important feature.
In his verses Ghione expresses a vivid feeling of the time that passes inexorably, and marks the moments of life, which can be recaptured with memory.
Paolo Bertolani (1956)
Bertolani, born in Serra di Lerici, was one of Liguria’s best-known poets nationwide.
Dedicating himself to the local tongue rather late in life, the fundamental theme of his poetry is an uninterrupted dialogue with the dead, a kind of regress into memory so as not to interrupt contact with loved ones, whose disappearance appears traumatic and incurable.
Literary suggestions – Pascoli in the first place – influenced the author, corroborated moreover by a linguistic research that “takes full advantage of the peculiarities of a medium of expression characterized by a very special musicality”.[1].
[1] F. Toso, Letteratura genovese e ligure – Il Novecento – I, Marietti, Genova, 1991.
As people, so do places and their memories disappear, swept away by time and progress.
The world that was once of those who disappeared, and as it was born of them, continues to stand on their invisible presence, their solicitude, ultimately their love.
Carlo Costa (1919–2000)
Among those who in some way worked for the preservation of the Ligurian language, one cannot forget the name of Carlo Costa from Chiavari. He was a professor of literature and history with many interests, who founded in his city numerous organizations, associations, and societies, not the least of which was the O Castello society for the preservation of local traditions.
He was an intimist poet, deeply influenced by classical literature, and he published A stradda (1982), Canson antiga (1989), Comme l’öchin (1994).
His translations into Ligurian from several Latin classics – such as Catullus, Tibullus, Horace – are of great interest, and were conducted with definite mastery of the subject.
Elsa Pastorino Alloisio (1918–2016)
Elsa Pastorino was born in Sestri Ponente, where she has always lived. As a young girl she started working for “Ceramica Ligure Vaccari” in Borzoli and then, after her marriage, went to work at home as an embroiderer of Genoese-style linens.
She directly experienced the dramatic years of World War II, was an anti-fascist and a politically committed woman on the left.
She began her work as a poet and promoter of the Ligurian language late in life and, despite not having had the opportunity to study, was considered a woman of great culture.
She actively participated in the production of the volume Ragazze di fabbrica edited by the Guerrazzi and Bruschi Sartori Libraries, with a video interview of her also transcribed in Genoese.
She donated copies of all her volumes to the Guerrazzi Library in Cornigliano and Bruschi Sartori Library in Sestri Ponente and bestowed significant gifts of volumes by other authors, on various subjects and genres, which she carefully selected and purchased.
Even today, her fairy tales and poems are still used for primary and secondary school activities on the Ligurian language.
More interesting than Elsa Pastorino’s poems, of naïve simplicity, are her short stories, where she evokes environments and situations of an era and mentality rather far removed from those of today, and they are not infrequently seasoned with a not-so-subtle social protest.
A good part of Elsa Pastorino’s activity was devoted to collecting traditional fairy tales, which, although not specifically Genoese in origin, had nevertheless become so, until they entered, in the form of proverbial sayings and idioms, into everyday speech.
The seguent, of the fox and the wolf, comes to us from Aesop and, with modifications and interpolations through the French tradition of the Roman de Renard, has come down to us in versions that are also very different from each other.
The sayings “Ran, ran, the sick carry the healthy” and “Lappo, lappo – And by the tail I’ll leave you there” were very frequent in the Genoese until not so long ago and hint at the original verse writing.
Fabrizio De André (1940–1999)
De André was one of the best known representatives of Italian songwriting in the second half of the 20th century. He belongs to the history of Ligurian literature because he is now an “iconic” character – as we say today – and in fact, his two albums Creusa de mâ (1984) and Le nuvole (1990), in their time, had a great impact on the image of Ligurian and Genoese in the world.
According to F. Toso, De André succeeded in making Genoa a symbol of the Mediterranean world.
There was no lack of criticism regarding the language he used, which was largely invented and artificial; and also regarding the content, based at times on inconsistent historical references. Nevertheless, De André had the ability to invoke an international perspective and way of thinking, to put words and expressions back into circulation giving them new meaning and vigour, and to make them known to the world.
Thanks to him, some interest in a language that was on the verge of dying was rekindled among the youth of a certain generation, resulting in the flourishing of groups, singers and musicians who, since the late 1980s, have been making music in Genoese.
The strong erotic – rather than pornographic – content of the lyrics, not uncommon also in De André’s Italian production, seems to be an expression of energy and lust for life, manifested in a way which breaks with established rules.
As mentioned above, some made up words can be found, such as “umedo” instead of “umio” and “arveâ” instead of “boggio” or “bresca” in the sense of beehive. These choices appear pointless, since more genuine terms still exist in Genoese.
The only justification may be the metrical rendering, the need to form a verse of fourteen syllables, a double septenary, or to have a rhyme at the end of the verse (“boggio” or “bresca” do not rhyme with “demoâ”).
In this famous song, we find a sense of adventure, but also a taste for original juxtapositions, bordering on the nonsensical, somewhat like the contemporary poetry of Guidoni and others.
Maria Terrile Vietz (1926–2016)
Maria Terrile Vietz was a well-known actress of Genoese theater, born in 1926 in Sampierdarena.
She began her theatrical activity in the postwar period, under the guidance of Emilio del Maestro, but it was especially after meeting Vito Elio Petrucci, with whom she had a long and fruitful artistic partnership, that she achieved wide acclaim and popularity.
She was the protagonist of more than twenty plays, particularly comedies, alternating her activity as an actress with cultural popularization on RAI and on the broadcaster Telegenova, leading a popular entertainment and information program for several years.
For her activities she received various theatrical and cultural awards. For fourteen years she was vice-president of the association A Compagna, as well as the first woman to hold leadership positions there.
In 2003 she founded an association dedicated to Petrucci, based at the Lercari Library in Villa Imperiale, dedicated to the teaching and dissemination of the Genoese language.
In 2012 she published with Erga Editions the book Fregogge de pan pöso, a collection of anecdotes and short stories.
She died in Genoa in February 2016, a month after turning ninety.
In her book Fregogge de pan pöso (2012, “Crumbs of stale bread”) Maria Terrile evokes characters and facts of the past, of local interest, between curiosity and joke, but with a remarkable liveliness similar to that which is needed in theater to attract the audience’s attention.
The only flaw is a Genoese that is a little too mixed with Italian, as indeed is often used on stage, in order to be better understood.
Fiorenzo Toso (1962–2022)
It seems that the first passion of the linguist, university lecturer, and poet Fiorenzo Toso was archaeology. After all, throughout his life he continued to study the past, digging not in the earth, but in language, in this enormous heritage of words that have been handed down to us, and which have not yet all been explored, studied, and catalogued. Toso was a word miner and once he had found these precious stones, he refined them and used them in poetry.
In the early days, when Toso’s poems first appeared, one might have thought that they were written in the dialect of Arenzano, a rustic Genoese, due to the prevalence of archaic, obsolete terms. In reality, it was a literary Genoese, constructed with the contribution of terms that were indeed rustic, but also cultured, taken from the lexicon of ancient Genoese writers.
All this in order to restore the dignity of Ligurian as a language, which had been lost due to social changes and various historical, political and literary events.
That was the intent, and indeed he had constructed a language, which was also at the same time his own style.
We are under no illusion that by simply using these same words, we will obtain a style equal or even only resembling Toso’s.
What is singular to his poetry is completely elusive. As with any true poet, his true personality lies in the style, in the combination of words, in something indefinable that cannot be recovered. It remains like a garden that can be observed from outside, at a certain distance, but which we can no longer enter.
Often, the protagonist of Toso’s poems is the Ligurian landscape, delicately revisited and reinvented with psychological connotations.
In this lyric and the next, one can sense the influence of J. V. Foix, an author with whom Toso shares the characteristic of being a “word hunter”, a hound of lexical recovery, but instead of the Catalan poet’s surrealist delirium, we soon recognise in these verses a much more placid air of our own homeland and a subdued allusion to the irreversible decline of the Ligurian hinterland.
Having returned to poetry after more than twenty years of creative hiatus, Toso seems to unify in this new phase the numerous cultural solicitations and stratifications and steer them towards a general recapitulation of his favourite themes and his existential quest, thereby also pursuing the aim of increasingly corroborating his project of re-founding in the modern era a literary Genoese language that is ductile, expressive to the utmost, and capable of expressing every nuance of thought.
The series of poems inspired by Joaquin Sorolla’s paintings express the sensations felt by the poet in front of the Catalan painter’s works and could be likened to certain Baroque works that sought to fuse together different art forms, but it makes us think above all of theatre: the author gives his voice to characters that present themselves to his imagination one after the other and makes them act for us.
In this, Toso is close to his favourite author, Gian Giacomo Cavalli, whose poetry, while falling within the canons of lyric poetry, has a theatrical background, with a typical search for the precious, refined effect, beyond the concepts that the text expresses.
The long navigation through life, obscured by the seafaring metaphor, eventually sees, as in a glimmer, the presence of the sacred revealed, of an undefined and absolutely nonconfessional God.
Fiorenzo Toso’s prose was almost all about social, sometimes satirical themes. In the case of Serv’assæ he attempted instead a topic with supernatural overtones, although there is no shortage of political overtones, but very distilled and only in the background.
The South American setting, with its reference to the events and lives of Genoese immigrants in Latin America, also allows for the clear allusion to the world of Indian shamans that Castaneda introduced us to, with his enigmatic stories of don Juan.
The recorded voice is that of Toso himself, one of his rare recordings in Genoese.
Anselmo Roveda (1972)
Roveda is a writer and scholar of popular literature and traditions. He has written over 20 books for children in Italian, some of them award-winning and translated abroad. He is adjunct professor of Screenplay II (Analysis of Narrative Structures and Elements of Creative Writing) at ISIA in Urbino and assistant director of the magazine Andersen.
Born at a time when Genoese had become a language, as he puts it, “of bocce and cards, of vegetable gardens and football, of swearing and mottos”, but driven by the need to use a idiom that was “strongly his own, and at the same time a universal, historical language, made from the lives of those who had lived”, he had to study it laboriously, starting precisely from the “rafataggi”, the leftovers of the language that the generations who lived before us have left us.
In short, it was about finding a meeting point between an ancient tradition and modernity with its challenges, which cannot be ignored, so that the former is revitalized by it and the latter humanized, enlivened by the memory and experience of the past.
Very often Roveda, with his lyrics, immerses himself in a sunny Mediterranean world – where even a Genoese could find himself – with the hope of giving new life to our traditions by leaning on those of peoples who are related to us, an operation already attempted in their own way by Giuliano Balestreri and De André: a trip to Galicia, Rome or Tokyo, a recollection of Amalia Rodrigues, a quotation from Buttitta are found on this psychological and literary journey, while the topical poems again fall within that tradition of civic engagement, which is typical of literature in Genoese.
Enrica Arvigo (1963)
Enrica Arvigo is a graduate in Modern Literature from the University of Genoa and a public servant.
For many years she has engaged in praiseworthy work to popularize, promote and safeguard the Genoese language by means of courses, lectures and public readings.
She has been writing since 1980 and has won numerous awards in regional and national poetry competitions. She is also a graphic designer of considerable talent.
The broken verse, which tends to be short, anxious, often illuminated by otherworldly chills, introduces us to the trepidatious world of the author, intent on spying on the slightest stirrings of life and hope in all that happens.
Her faith in the perpetual rebirth of men and things is, at times, moving and, on closer inspection, constitutes perhaps the only possible response, in the face of small and great tragedies in everyone’s life.
Compare with the lyric by B. Pedemonte, on the same subject, which we read earlier. We have no intellectualistic pedantry here either, but the often dark and labored imagery expresses suffering, exclusion and loneliness, in a much more pessimistic context.
Any hope of survival is uncertain, entrusted to the memory that departed loved ones have left among us.
Objects and events are often used to vicariously experience or relive personal pains and anxieties.
Thus the author’s sense of exclusion, of separateness from the rest of the world, is transferred into the doll.
Enrico Granara (1955)
We transcribe here the note Enrico Granara wrote about himself:
Recently, Granara has collected in a volume, I zinæ de Zena (The Horizons of Genoa), his works of translation and adaptation into Genoese of various literary texts and news articles, often related to life at sea and the presence of Ligurians overseas.
A book that – beyond the value of the individual texts – makes us reflect once again on the complicated network of relationships in the destiny of this people linked to navigation.
Achille in Sciro (1830)
Performed for the 1830 carnival at the Teatro S. Agostino, Achilles in Sciro is an anonymously penned parody in Genoese of Pietro Metastasio’s verse drama of the same name. Since Metastasio was the classic court poet, most appreciated by the ancien régime, it is believed that this mise-en-scène – with its attack on certain characters and its long-outdated literary style that was nevertheless quite alive in the minds of the Savoy court at the time – hides a veiled criticism against Savoy rule. It is known that King Charles Felix had old-fashioned literary tastes, an object of irony even in Turin.
The parody was even performed by a company of hunchback actors (according to a note on the title page of the printed edition), which may allude to the well-known physical deformities and psychological defects of the representatives of the royal family. Finally, it is interesting to note that the language used in the parody, from the very first lines, is among the most colloquial found in Genoese literature. This is undoubtedly due the author’s intention of creating a strong contrast with the courtly material of the original text.
Aldo Acquarone (1898–1964)
Loyal to the metrical form of the sonnet, Acquarone depicted stereotypical “dialectal” scenes his whole life that sought to emulate the contemporary Romanesque experiences of Trilussa or Pascarella.
However, he did not succeed in creating an authentically popular poem, and in fact did not even want to. He was too disillusioned with life, which had been harsh to him and made him cynical about ideologies and ideals. In this regard, he perhaps tracts with other poets in Liguria, none of whom (least of all Firpo, despite numerous attempts) was ever able to write comedic, satirical, or socially invigorating poetry that was as convincing as, or at all rivalrous of, that of authors from other regions.
For some reason, the most genuine tendency of poetry in Genoese has always been elitist and aristocratic.
Acquarone is no exception: a critic once went so far as to speak of Acquarone as a poet “with a soft rhotic” (commonly seen as an affectation of the bourgeoisie). Acquarone does, in fact, flaunt a detached irony in the face of his “working class” characters, even if he does not exhibit a total lack human pity towards them. This stance is nevertheless emblematic of a certain type of Genoese attitude, disenchanted and almost cynical, especially before and after World War II.
The language used, strongly Italianized, accords with the poetic style - a bourgeoisie expression devoid of great moral tension, at least on the surface.
Acquarone published several collections of poems during his lifetime, later compiled in the volume I sonetti (1959).
He was also the author of two well-received comedies for Gilberto Govi: Quande o gatto o no gh’é (1927) and Bocce (1930), in which he does not deviate much from the usual clichés of Govian theatre.
Acquarone excels at depicting a derelict (but ultimately happy) humanity that does not demand much from life and symbolizes a world where time passes us by without us even realising it.
In the second sonnet, the satire strikes at the empty rituals of bureaucracy and politics, which see to it that everyone is democratically elected, even “the village idiot”.
At times Acquarone’s often cynical humour melts into a quiet melancholy.
Although a secular spirit, the author feels the distance between the world of naive faith of the ancients and an unprejudiced, and seemingly freer, world.
The sonnet, probably inspired by the tragic fate of Friedrich Nietzsche, reflects bitterly on human destiny beneath a lauditory façade.
Even in the darkest moments, one can find humor. A spirit like Acquarone, who is fundamentally secular, sees the general indifference towards the sick person that dies alone by reducing the crucifix to an object of practical utility.
Alerame Traversagni (15th cent.)
The first writer from Savona (in chronological order) whose name is known is Alerame Traversagni who, in 1455, wrote a vernacularisation of the life of Saint Elisabeth of Hungary. Alerame belonged to an illustrious Savona family of famous humanists, such as Giovanni Antonio, author of ascetic and mathematical works, and Fra’ Lorenzo Guglielmo (1422-1503), who taught philosophy and theology in Pisa, Rome, Paris, Cambridge and Toulouse.
Almost nothing is known about Alerame, but perhaps the life of Sancta Elisabeth is only a fragment of a longer work on the lives of saints, which has been lost.
The author makes it clear that he intended to show how a lay woman could arrive at holiness through primarily human endowments, such as penance, charity, and works of mercy, while remaining in touch with the world.
Consequently, the marvellous and supernatural elements are reduced to a minimum and the story almost reveals a rationalist conception, in a certain modern sense.
The text also shows an unusual care for form and also testifies to the presence of a rather refined cultural milieu - the same from which the great affirmation of the Della Rovere papal dynasty would soon originate.
The language used is the decadent Ligurian of the late 15th century that is heavily mixed with Tuscan, but clearly recognisable.
Ambrogio Conti (18th cent.)
He was friends with De Franchi, with whom he exchanged letters, containing advice and sometimes discussions in verse. He collaborated on the translation of Jerusalem Delivered, while, on his own, he was more of an occasional poet.
In this letter in verse addressed to De Franchi, he lets off steam by complaining about his role as a tutor in a patrician family that provides him with food in exchange for a great deal of extra duties that relegate him to undue servitude. From this situation, Conti draws the pretex for some reflections on the life of man from birth to old age.
Anonymous authors of 1746
It inspired not only the verses of De Franchi and Gallino, but also many other anonymous poets - some on the populist side, others more clearly on the aristocratic side, but all animated by great patriotic ardour. In common love for Genoa, the social classes seemed to reconcile and a sort of popular epic was born in the name of the fight against the invaders.
Among the various poems about the facts of 1746, of note are the Trionfo reportao da ro popolo zeneize and the Libeazion dra Sittæ de Zena.
The former is a crude versification, but important for its historical accuracy in recalling the events. We have selected the verses concerning the Balilla episode, while from the latter we have taken the sonnets that deal with the sacrifice of Pier Maria Canevari, a young patrician who, having distinguished himself at various stages of the revolt, died at the Scoffera from a treacherous blow.
[1] The Austrian general Botta Adorno was of Genoese origin and therefore particularly disliked by the population, who considered him a traitor.
In this poem of aristocratic leanings, we are told the story of Pier Maria Canevari, a patriot who heroically fights and is treacherously murdered near the Scoffera, while other equally important but popular characters are left in the shadows, or not mentioned at all.
The verses flow well, but the spelling is so irregular that many times doubts are left as to the meaning and true pronunciation of the words.

Barnaba Cigala Casero (16th–17th cent.)
As far as we know, Barnaba Cigala Casero (16th century, early 17th century) was the first to compose eulogies in the Genoese language on the occasion of election of the Doge (for Antonio Cebà, in 1593, and for Agostino Doria, in 1601), a literary genre that would be brought to the height of artistic expression by Cavalli a few years later.
In the first encomium, Cigala shows his intention to prudently advise the patricians on what to do for the good of the state, while in the second he devotes himself more to extolling the family of the new Doge and its importance in the history of Genoa. In doing so he anticipates Cavalli’s poetry, in which praise is not much more than a pretext for a display of stylistic prowess.
In any case, the Genoese language becomes a symbol of the political diversity of the Republic and its people, as there can be no suspicion of a nostalgic and “conservative” use of the language, certainly even less so than in Foglietta’s polemical verses about the “robes”.
Another important aspect of Cigala’s poetry is the Petrarchan love lyric, as in the Ottave a Margherita and the song Quando un fresco, soave, dolce vento, where he succeeds in adapting to the Ligurian environment images that in his time might have already seemed old-fashioned, with freshness of language and a profound sense of the musicality of words.
One might think that Cigala’s work was destined to remain the patrimony of a literary elite and never to leave the milieu of the Court: instead, still in 1840, in the Folk Songs of Porto Maurizio, collected by Bartolomeo Acquarone, we find a parodic echo from the Ottave a Margherita: “Did you think you had bewitched me / making you mistress of my heart?” says the anonymous poet from the east – which proves that those ancient verses were well known even on the Riviera, centuries later, and in environments far removed from those for which they were written.
In this famous song, Petrarchan in style, but nonetheless powerfully original, one can say that Cigala, the poet of “maravegia”, of astonishment before the beauty of woman, felt to be a personification of the divine spirit that animates nature, heralds all the subsequent developments of a large part of Genoese lyric poetry, from Cavalli to De Franchi and Firpo.
In this well-known poem, of which we only quote the first part, Cigala, like Foglietta, transposes Stilnovist or Petrarchan themes to a domestic and urban setting, but the woman is angelic only in the eyes of the lover, who is so taken with her that he imagines her to be a superhuman being; the poet realises his own weakness and all the octaves are based on a light self-irony.
In his speeches for the election of the Doge, Cigala adheres to a practice that called for conventional praise and restrained, generic criticism, addressed to the political class, followed by equally generic advice, exhorting the people and politicians to harmony, to all stand united, in the name of the Nation’s prosperity.
In an exposition that is usually flat and monotonous, the poet rarely achieves strokes of inspiration, with references to the civil poetry of the Anonym.
Anonymous tercets from Rime diverse (16th cent.)
These tercets, from an anonymous poet whose work was published in the anthology Rime Diverse, give us a glimpse of a personality different from that of his contemporary authors. As F. Toso remarks, “In a monologue that takes the form of an admission of guilt, but also as a call to remedy the impasse that marks the crisis of a feeling, the anonymous achieves accents of rude directness, which make this poem a text in its own way unique in the sphere of literature in Genoese…”.
It is regrettable that, of this author’s production, very far from the Petrarchism of his time and from any declamatory temptation, no other example is known.
Giovanni Casaccia (1813–1882)
Giovanni Casaccia is the author of the most famous Genoese-Italian dictionary, which came out in two editions, in 1851 and 1876, and of a grammar that has remained unpublished. He tried to bring order to Genoese spelling, a plan that succeeded only in part, and bequeathed us many doubts and uncertainties that continue to the present day.
But he was also a continuer of the work of Piaggio, and he compiled Lunäio do Sciô Regiña from 1844 to 1863 (with the exception of the 1847 edition, when Luigi Doria took care of it, and the 1850 edition entrusted to Cristoforo Castellini).
A combative liberal, in contrast to Piaggio, and similar in ideas to Pedevilla, Casaccia also published a collection of poems, A sanfòrnia zeneise (The Genoese mouth harp; 1852 and 1863). Apart from the clearly political and polemical texts, there are also “visions”, a literary device that in Genoese goes back as far as Cavalli’s time, if not earlier, where the author imagines meeting influential deceased personalities who invest him with some mission in the world of the living.
Here, Casaccia meets Ballin, the fisherman alter ego of Cavalli, who tasks him with celebrating the coming to Genoa of the famous Ferrarese preacher and patriot Ugo Bassi, who a few years later would die a martyr for the Unification of Italy.
[1] “Cava” and “Stria” were two beaches, below Carignano, where nowadays the road known as “Circonvallazione a mare” runs.
Casaccia imagines that Cavalli, who lived – in his mind – in a backward age, a “cesspool of idiots”, when a poet could only glorify the powerful, encourages the modern poet to deal with “noble subjects”, now that times permit. In particular, the arrival in Genoa of Ugo Bassi, the Jesuit patriot.
After boasting of the qualities of the preacher, who is supposed to be so important in Casaccia’s eyes as a patriot and republican rather than as a man of religion, the shadow of Cavalli recedes.
