Origins of the Ligurian language
Little or nothing is known of the Ligurian language before the Roman conquest. What little is known is deduced from toponymy – such as the famous ending in -asko/a of many place names, supposedly meaning “house” – and from a few rare testimonies by classical authors, such as saliunka, “species of valerian”, and sigynnai, “merchants”.
Nor can much be deduced from the inscriptions – written with characters derived from Etruscan – on the statues-stelae in Lunigiana, apart from a few names such as the word Mezunemushus on one of them, about which many hypotheses have been made.
On the other hand, the first document where the presence of terms in the Ligurian vernacular can be observed, in a Latin context, is the Testament of Raimondo Pictenado from 1156, followed a few years later by the Paxia declaration (1178-82) in Savona, two lists of objects in which the original Ligurian names can be recognised in their Latinised form.
Already at that time, one can observe the characteristics of a spelling system that have continued to this day; “x” for the voiced palatal fricative: rexentar (contemporary Genoese: ruxentâ), “ç” for the voiceless palatal affricate: lençoles (contemporary Genoese: lençeu) and other analogous examples.
Following this, it is only in 1269 that we have the first evidence of ancient Genoese in a public record, on the tombstone of the two brothers Simonetta and Percivalle Lercari, found in 1873 in S. Giovanni di Pré, which can now be seen in the Museum of S. Agostino, and which reads:
After the Latin text explaining who is buried there, comes a couplet of rhymed senari in Genoese, intended to arouse the reader’s pity, in an almost informal tone.
Raimbaut was a Provençal troubadour, the first to use Genoese with a literary, albeit parodistic and comical intent.
His Genoese is mixed with Provençalisms and we are not even sure whether he had ever been to Genoa, or whether he relied on elements reported by someone.
In Contrasto con la donna genovese, a jester, who tries to seduce a woman, receives only dry rebukes.
To the declarations of love, all in Provençal, the woman replies with rejection and, after a long squabble, the woman tells the poet to go to hell: it is a parody of the literary fashion and customs of courtly love in vogue at the time, and the Genoese with their harsh language and their reputation, even then, as tough and direct people, were well suited to mocking the refined poetic conventions of the noble courts.
The woman replies as follows to the propositions:
This song, discovered in 1951 by R. Giazotto, dates back to 1269 (although there are some problems in the transcription of the text) and not only testifies to the existence of a poetic production in Genoese a few years before that of the Genoese Anonym, but it is also the first song in Genoese that we know of.
The note at the end of the text also tells us that there were other songs, on the subject of love, in the metrical form of the strambotto, a kind of song that was widespread in the Italian area.
There is a beautiful version of this text in music, sung by Roberta Alloisio and included in her album Lingua serpentina (2007).
Public speeches of the 15th century
In the 15th century, official, or semi-official, uses of the Genoese vernacular became increasingly widespread, which would last until the 18th century. Propositions, such as those we give as examples, were presented to the Council of Elders by a Chancellor, who many times displayed such oratory skill and formal elegance that these appeals, addressed to patriotism and civic sense, were of some literary interest.
The Genoese used, if one takes into account the partly Tuscanized spelling, which masks the speaker’s true pronunciation, seems quite straightforward and pure: conseiar is pronounced “cunsegiar”; ge is pronounced “ghe”; jorni, as “giurni”; pù, as “ciü”.
Giovanni Andrea Spinola (1625–1705)
Giovanni Andrea Spinola belonged to a distinguished patrician family and was, in 1673, governor of Corsica, ambassador to Madrid in 1678 and also governor of Savona in 1692.
He corresponded with many Italian academies and men of letters, he considered himself, as indeed he was, the inventor of melodrama for music with parts in Genoese. In his operas, L’Ariodante inspired by Ariosto, L’Europa taken from Greek mythology, and La perfidia fulminata da Sansone from the Bible, written to be set to music, he introduces characters who sing in Genoese.
As is to be expected, the usual character of the corporal makes an appearance, exhibiting more positive characteristics in Spinola’s dramas than it did when it was brought to the stage by his predecessors.
Perhaps because of the changed political conditions, with a Republic now less influenced by Spanish politics, the corporal seems less willing to bend before the powerful.
In this monologue intended to be sung, the corporal, aside from his warlike prowess, boasts – unusually – his skills as a cook, amid double entendres and allusions that are not always easy to understand.
Italo Mario Angeloni (1876–1957)
A teacher of Literature and then of History of Art in secondary schools, a journalist, photographer and ceramist, Angeloni spent most of his life in Turin, where he was close to the neo-felibrist movement of “Ij Brandé” and it is no coincidence that the preface to his collection of Genoese verse was written by Nino Costa, one of the fathers of the renewal of Piedmontese poetry.
In Angeloni, if we exclude some occasional concessions to the tired conventions of “dialectal” poetry, we can observe a moderate renovation of poetic language; the author is familiar with contemporary Italian and foreign poetry and takes due account of it.
Angeloni pursues a poetic of renewal in Genoese, in constant search of a “high” level, not unlike that of his contemporary Edoardo Firpo, while being completely independent from it.
But that vein, which in the self-taught Firpo only transpires in rapid and rare flashes amid much ballast, flows more steadily in Angeloni, through the author’s more structured cultural training.
F. Toso finds in his verses “impressionistic procedures clearly influenced by the experimentalism of the time”,[1] and certainly Angeloni gives his compositions a rapid, modern, nervous edge, although more daring choices on a formal level, such as those advocated by Hermeticism or Futurism, remain far beyond his reach.
He was also a historian and literary critic and it is worth mentioning in this respect his successful volume on Dino Frescobaldi’s Rime, while a very harsh review of La via del rifugio (1907) in the pages of the newspaper Il Momento seems to have given Gozzano some displeasure, with whom he later reconciled, after a meeting in Cornigliano, the place chosen by both as a seaside resort; Indeed, the themes and motifs of Angeloni’s poems, himself a lyricist with a Parnassian background, are often reminiscent of the poet of the Signorina Felicita.
He also wrote Italian and Piedmontese verse.
[1] F. Toso, Letteratura genovese e ligure in genovese e nei dialetti locali, Le Mani, 2009.
In the portrayal of feelings, Angeloni always uses delicacy and sensitivity; in this poem, the platonic relationship between the two characters is summed up by a tender and mischievous sexual metaphor (without being crass).
Angeloni’s favourite themes are also often borrowed from Pascoli, from European symbolism and from decadentism.
This “voice in the fog” laden with mystical-religious suggestions, and similar to other “voices”, e.g. Pascoli’s, may come in a literal sense from the mountains of Crocefieschi, an inland village called “a Croxe” in Genoese, but also, in an indefinite and allusive way, from the cross of the Calvary, just as the garden where the poet is kneeling could be the garden of Gethsemane.
We will later hear another voice in the fog, Dialogo into caligo, among Plinio Guidoni’s lyrics, without explicit reference to religion, with more postmodern awareness and less immediacy.
In this poem, as in the following two, one of Angeloni’s favourite themes, love, is treated with the delicacy that is characteristic of this author.
Here again, external elements transpose the poet’s moods onto a physical and material plane: the overgrown hedge conceals nostalgia and memories, and also the awareness of his mother’s death.
The images, always subtle and elegant, emphasising delicate nuances of moods testify to Angeloni’s adherence to the floral and Art Nouveau taste of his time.
As in certain Baroque poetry, external objects, even those from everyday life, become witnesses and symbols of the poet’s feelings and torment.
The poem Balilla, dedicated to the events of 1746, suffers from a fundamental ideological ambiguity, in that the events, as was the custom at the time Angeloni wrote, are reinterpreted in a Risorgimento key, concealing the fact that Italians too, specifically the Piedmontese, were allied to the Austrian invaders.
And yet «Genoese» patriotism is evident in the author and contends in his soul for first place with «Italian» patriotism.
[2] The Austrian commander, when the wagon carrying a mortar ran aground through the Piccapietra area in the popular Portoria district, ordered the bystanders to help the soldiers in the necessary operations to free the barrel, without any compensation, while threatening to strike them if they did not comply with the command; this was the cause of the popular uprising.

Vincenzo Jacono (1887–1970)
Jacono was a well-known Sanremese author, who created the character of Bigin Sciacastrasse, a gossipy washerwoman with a sharp tongue, who in the theater and newspapers exchanged fulminating jokes with her friend-enemy Mastr’Antò o Basté (invented by Gin De Stefani).
These characters were intended to represent the sentiments of old-fashioned people from Sanremo, conservative and wise, enemies of all novelty. It does not seem that Jacono ever went further than the creation of these characters, which in any case completely met the taste of the public of his time.
Another character of his own invention was Bacì Süssatapi, that served him to tell the history of San Remo in his own way.
Old Bacì narrates in his own way the history of Sanremo, in front of a huddle of friends who listen to him with interest.
In italics the commentary of one of them.
Bigin is supposed to be the true Sanremo commoner and expresses what the author believes are the feelings of the common people in the face of changes in modern society.
As is often the case, one word (“stupin”) becomes the symbol of changing customs.
Plinio Guidoni (1922–1994)
It can be said that Guidoni was one of the very few authors in Ligurian who managed to attract the attention of Italian critics[1][2].
He was a bank official, who lived for a long time in Rome, where he collaborated on several occasions with the poet-publisher Mario Dell’Arco and came into contact with very different cultural circles, which undoubtedly played some role in distancing him from the conditioning of the Genoese cultural milieu, which was so closed and provincial.
This writer and scholar of literature in Ligurian, who only grudgingly and for chronological reasons accepted the label “neo-dialectal”, had begun his literary activity in the 1960s, collaborating on RAI regional broadcasts, for which he composed numerous single-act plays in Genoese, showing even then a clear propensity to break out of the mold of “dialectal” theater that would later lead him to write the more mature dramas, such as O blòcco and Briscola.
At the same time, his poetic work was moving away from both the Firpian imitation and the mainly comic poetry still in vogue at the time, approaching rather a poetry of social denunciation, which owed something to the Pavese of Lavorare stanca; an author who, without opinion, accompanies Guidoni to his last pages, like when he evokes the fate of the agave that “straight into the sun, / when it blooms it dies, / dies of love”.
Both Guidoni’s theatrical production and poems are gradually loaded with symbols and allusions to a truth that lies beyond the perceptible world, until what he called “fantasy” takes over – subtle images and enigmatic figurations that invite us to meditate on another reality, parallel to our own, figurations where what is unspoken is almost more important than what is said, since it alludes to all the things that can never be expressed in words.
[1] M. Chiesa, G. Tesio, Le parole di legno.
Poesia in dialetto del ’900 italiano, Milano, 1984.
[2] F. Brevini, Le parole perdute, Milano, 1990.
The collection Sette corali presents seven compositions inspired by listening to as many of Bach’s chorales.
Guidoni’s first collection presented various connections with the secular history of Genoa, but already from a transfiguring and symbolic perspective.
The memory of the war and deportation to Germany returns frequently in Guidoni’s work.
Sometimes Guidoni draws inspiration from the figurative arts. Here from The Scream by Munch.
More war memories, against the backdrop of the Cinque Terre.
In these two unpublished poems, submitted to the 1975 “Lauro d’Oro” competition but excluded from subsequent collections, one can see a Guidoni still tied in part to the Genoese tradition of social poetry, composed in a narrative/discursive language.
Once again in this “Dialogue”, an “other”, secret or veiled reality is alluded to. To whom is the poet speaking?
And what of?
To God?
To a departed loved one of his?
All questions remain unanswered and refer us to an “elsewhere”.
Perhaps the important thing is not what they will have said to each other, and who spoke, but the very act of asking the question.

Another favorite theme of Guidoni’s poetry is the reference to a life devoid of compromise and more worth living, set against the grayness of everyday existence.
In his original plays Plinio Guidoni borrows the cadences and stylistic features of the theater of the absurd, from Ionesco, to Beckett, to Pinter, adapting them to typically Ligurian places and characters, in an extraordinarily successful mixture, predominated by anguish, doubt, and the mystical expectation of something to come.
Guidoni must be credited with going his own way, amid misunderstandings from traditionalist devotees, as well as from the academic milieu, who – with very few exceptions – did not understand the novelty of his language and creations, which were moving toward a Genoese as a “total” language.
Beginning with O Blòcco, with which he won the “Anna Caroli” prize in 1985, Guidoni moved farther and farther away from the conventional theater in Genoese, and in his works, with a play of catchphrases, clichés, incomprehensible events, and a sense of anguish, the characters grasp desperately at a semblance of normalcy, which they can never again attain, until their destiny is fulfilled.
Andrea Capano (1953)
Capano, a high school French teacher, has published several collections of poems, including A sgavàudura e u dagliu (1986) and Teragnae (1987).
He is a poet of the futility of existence and does not spare harsh attacks on today’s false and consumerist society.
Far from the felibrism of A barma grande, Capano’s Ventimigliese is primarily an expression of the author’s existential loneliness.
Franco D’Imporzano (1940-2019)
Franco D’Imporzano was a bank clerk, but he also devoted much of his life to the study and appreciation of the San Remo dialect. He was a theatrical author and actor, who published the plays L’umbra de Cleupatra (1971), E bügne du sciù Steva (1974) and, in collaboration with Nini Sappia, A s’ciürma do Tricche-Tracche performed by the Compagnia Stabile “Città di Sanremo”.
As for poetry he published Deixe süneti aragiai e trei puemeti stravaganti (1979), Vedri d’aiga durse (1992) and A veja magìgura (1999).
As a poet, D’Imporzano stood out, in his first publication, for his social and satirical engagement against the degraded state of society of his time, while in his second book he gave voice to a more bluntly lyrical, novel and persuasive vein.
Marco Carbone (1966)
Carbone was born in Genoa, and calls himself a “street poet, self-taught musician, drum maker”.
He is a veteran of the Italian reggae scene and has been active in the Genovese sphere for about twenty-five years, self-producing small collections of verses and “Januaican music”, his personal reinvention and re/creation of Jamaican music in a Genoese context.
Carbone tells us about a reality where “similar sounds of different languages are pursued, new words are born from the contamination and mingling of different ethnicities and cultures, all in search of a way out of this current system that dictates absurd rules to preserve the privileges of a few at the expense of the welfare of the many… the Genoese language, which for centuries has made its own words from the various Mediterranean languages it has encountered or with which it has clashed throughout history, mixes in this global world with the Jamaican culture and the sounds of reggae in a mix theorized in some ways also by the Creolité movement, which tends to the valorization of kréyol as a new culture in its own right, a melting pot of various cultures and traditions, which precisely in the Caribbean have found a strange way to mix…”.
He further adds, “So, open doors to contamination, which for languages is the only way to stay alive…”.
Carbone’s poems, intended primarily to be sung and “interpreted” by their author in dub poetry or reggae style, are collected in numerous out-of-print self-publishings.
Here the god Ogun (the Niger River) is identified, in the Brazilian syncretic rite of Umbanda, with St. George, the traditional dragon-slaying patron saint of the Genoese, as the one who will restore order and some form of social justice among us.
A millenarian and religious yearning for justice is evident in Carbone, frequently expressed even by means of verbatim quotations from Scripture, curiously mixed with proverbs, popular sayings, and expressions typical of Genoese.
[1] “o droghê o se mangia o succao e o caigâ o va co-e scarpe rotte” (“the grocer eats sugar and the cobbler walks with broken shoes”): Genoese sayings, indicating situations in which those who work are unable to make up for their toil or efforts, failing even to provide for themselves.
In many cases with Carbone we are faced with “service” poetry, in which the urgency of denouncing the injustices of the capitalist and globalist system overrides all other considerations.
Daring juxtapositions and word coinages, unusual associations of ideas in surrealist style are characteristic of Carbone’s poetry.

Maria Pia Viale (1958)
Maria Pia Viale was born in Vallebona (province of Imperia). She is a farmer, and has worked on the history of the Imperia area for the agricultural sector.
She wrote Un viaggio chiamato ginestra.
Breve storia della floricoltura di Vallebona (2007).
For Ames and Cia she published Le radici di un percorso.
L’associazionismo agricolo nella provincia di Imperia (2009) and the journal l’Agricoltura ligure (2010).
A devotee of dialects, she has been active for years in organizing the Intemelio Dialectal Poetry Prize “U Giacuré” in Vallebona and chairs the jury of the Giannino Orengo Dialectal Poetry Competition in Dolceacqua.
Since November 2013, she has published a vernacular poem every day on the blog U paise (www.upaise.blogspot.it), covering the entire Ligurian territory and the area of the Maritime Alps, creating a remarkable web archive.
Her poems have never been published in print.

Alessandro Guasoni (1958)
Born in Voltri (near Genoa) in 1958, he has been writing poetry, short stories, theatre and essays in the Genoese language since 1973.
According to F. Toso, from a landscape constructed with incisive images, à la Sileri, comes a meditation of a pessimistic nature, centred on the theme of loneliness and existential precariousness”.
Over the years, elements drawn from philosophy and esotericism have been added to Guasoni’s meditations, but his lyricism is meant to be based on purely formal values, on the sound of the word, and on the secret that the word conceals, taking for granted that the world is not what it appears to us from the outside, but the word is what can reveal it to us, at least in part.
Guasoni thinks that a poem can be valid even without a precise content and that its value is already in the evocative perfection of the image and sound. The form is therefore already the content, and other meanings can be attributed to it by readers or by poets themselves, depending on the echo that the text awakens in them internally.
The same can be said of the short stories Guasoni has written. Formally stories of the fantastic or philosophical, they are designed to stir memories and feelings that change from one person to another, but always remaining attentive to the formal values of the text, which constitute its authentic content.
The fountain of this poem marks a motionless moment in the perfection of memory, a time that always returns to itself, cyclical, coming from God and returning to God.
Rhymes and alliterations accompany the concepts to follow their music.
Vice unlocks the immutability of the body, gives us a taste of an eternity in reverse, even if it is that of perdition; it makes us immortal by sucking us into pleasure and by following it the moment becomes eternal in an eternal recurrence.
The beauty of a plant is intended for us and no one else, and therefore its life, the sun that warms it, are within us and depend on us.
The subject that looks and feels is the true reason for the plant’s existence and that of all nature and contains it.
The power of the verse recalls the power of being in our consciousness, in an alchemical synthesis.
In his latest poems, Guasoni’s thoughts focus on cyclical time, the only one that can knock death off its feet, in its perpetual return to the source of consciousness, where it occupies no space, and yet is real.
The numbering corresponding to the original sylloge is retained.
In these verses, Guasoni tries to express his concepts in increasingly concentrated and synthetic images, bordering on aphasia, making them collide with each other to make sparks fly out, which can illuminate the truth of being.
Danila Olivieri (1955)
She is president of the Literary Forum “Pen(n)isola San Marco” in Sestri Levante and a jury member of the Giovanni Descalzo International Poetry and Fiction Prize.
He debuted with a sylloge of verse in the language: Sole di scirocco (Montedit), winner of the “Premio Internazionale Città di Monza” 2002; this was followed by the award-winning collections published by Montedit Voli nel profondo, (winner of the “Premio Nazionale Francesco Moro”, Pavia 2003); I giorni della merla, (winner of the “Premio Internazionale Città di Monza” 2006); Le parole del vento, (“Premio Internazionale Città di Monza” 2011); Il mio raccolto canto, (“Premio Nazionale Città di Melegnano” 2012).
In Ciottoli – a series cultural notebooks linked to the Trigoso area – she published two anthologies containing poems in both Genoese and Italian: Stella cometa à Tregosa and Dritto e Reverso.
About her choice to write in Genoese, she says: “I started writing in Zeneise because I liked to express certain memories linked to my childhood and the people who were part of it in my language of the heart and affections.
Until a few years ago, I spoke it at home with my father, who passed away at the age of 94”.
Mario Dentone wrote of her: “Many of Olivieri’s compositions are in Genoese, and they all preserve that small world of the author’s own life, and every corner of the sea or forest, house and garden, in poetry becomes a bit like Leopardi’s hedge, a small thing that reveals the infinite, which is given by memories without a horizon, where one can dive with the happiness found in every verse, even in the sad moments of pain and nostalgia, because poetry is consolation…”.
And Francesco Mario Rossi: “Danila Olivieri’s verses, in the Genoese language, have all the peculiarity of true poetry.
If we translate them into Italian, they become something else, colder, more detached and without the melody of natural sound… Thus [in Genoese] assonances, alliterations, rhymes are born with a musicality that has the flavour of ‘once upon a time’, reproducing the sounds and scent of the sea, the flapping of the waves and the blowing of the wind”.
