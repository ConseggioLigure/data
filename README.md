# Ligurian datasets

This repository lists resources such as datasets and corpora which are useful for NLP/AI applications and other language technologies involving the Ligurian language.

## Ligurian varieties

All datasets listed on this page pertain to Genoese, by far the most widespread variety of Ligurian (both in terms of number of speakers and geographic area). Its codified traditional orthography form is the de facto standard for literary and academic works.

When developing NLP models it is important to recognize that other Ligurian varieties are written differently, and many of them lack a written standard. Even Genoese itself can also be written according to multiple spellings. Therefore, it is crucial not to blindly mix content of different varieties from uncurated sources (such as Wikipedia) without properly understanding and labelling it.

## Datasets

### Machine translation

Hosted here:
* [Seed](seed/) is a trilingual Ligurian-English-Italian machine translation dataset based on the OLDI [Seed dataset](https://github.com/openlanguagedata/seed). Released under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
* [FLORES](https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores/blob/main/flores200/README.md) is a machine translation benchmark that supports Ligurian. Released under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
* [ZenaMT](zenamt/) is an Italian–Ligurian (Genoese) parallel corpus covering a number of domains of cultural relevance to Ligurian speakers. Some sentences also have English translations. Released under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Hosted elsewhere:
* Google’s [GATITOS](https://github.com/google-research/url-nlp/tree/main/gatitos) dataset is a high-quality multi-way parallel lexicon which includes Ligurian. Released under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).


### Text corpora

Hosted here:
* A [monolingual corpus of Ligurian](monolingual/), under development, useful for a variety of applications such as the training of language models. Released under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

### Text normalization

Hosted here:
* [Normalized Ligurian corpus](normalization/), a collection of sentences written in Ligurian using historical spellings, paired with their normalized version. It can be used to train text normalizers. Released under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

### Dependency parsing

Hosted elsewhere:
* [UD-Ligurian-GLT](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Ligurian-GLT/), a [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) corpus for Ligurian. Released under [C-UDA 1.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/C-UDA-1.0.html).

### Others

Hosted here:
* [TeX hyphenation patterns](hyph-lij/) for the Genoese Ligurian language. Released under [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

Hosted elsewhere:
* The [GEPHRAS](https://romanistik-gephras.uibk.ac.at/content?page=home) project is a Ligurian-Italian online phraseological dictionary which includes phonetic transcriptions and audio recordings for many entries.
