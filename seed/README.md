# Italian-Ligurian seed data

This folder contains Italian, Ligurian and English versions of the [Seed](https://github.com/openlanguagedata/seed) dataset. The English and Ligurian versions come straight from the original dataset. The Italian version was obtained by machine translating the original English sentences, with further post-editing by an experienced (human) translator.
